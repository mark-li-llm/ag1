These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often.\nWe may use our own technology or third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.\nSalesforce may also use HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for the above-mentioned purposes. These technologies differ from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store, and how they store it.\nWe need your prior consent to use functional cookies.

For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting our websites.\nSalesforce also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, from emails and on third-party websites. Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different websites or other online services by collecting certain data through automated means, including through the use of cookies.

Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our websites. Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.\n4.5 Social Media Features\nOur websites may use social media features, such as the “Tweet” button and other sharing widgets (“Social Media Features”).

To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the platforms themselves, and you click through to these from our websites, the platform may receive information showing that you have visited our websites. If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our websites with your social media profile.\nSalesforce also allows you to log in to certain of our websites using sign-in services.
