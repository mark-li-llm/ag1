Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. \nIn light of these and other risks and uncertainties, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not occur as we expect or at all, and our actual results or outcomes may differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nSalesforce, Inc. (“Salesforce,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology, enabling companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers through the power of data, artificial intelligence (“AI”), CRM and trust. Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform. \nOur AI-powered Salesforce Platform unites our offerings — spanning sales, service, marketing, commerce, collaboration, integration, AI, analytics, automation, industries and more — by connecting customer data across systems, applications and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient and deliver intelligent, personalized and automated experiences across every channel. With Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform, our customers can build and augment their teams with an always-on digital labor force, deploying autonomous AI agents across business functions that aim to increase productivity, lower costs and drive operational efficiencies.\nOur service offerings are designed to be flexible, scalable and easy to use. They can generally be configured easily, deployed rapidly and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications. We sell to businesses worldwide, primarily on a subscription basis, through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. In addition, we enable third parties to use our platform and developer tools to create additional functionality and new applications that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service offerings.\nSalesforce is committed to a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability – all of which are grounded in legal and regulatory frameworks that guide and inform our business. Foremost among these is trust, which is paramount and the foundation for everything we do, and is also firmly rooted in compliance with applicable laws governing security, privacy, data protection and operational integrity. Our customers expect to trust and rely on our technology to meet the high enterprise-grade standards of security, privacy, performance, legal compliance and availability at scale. Customer success is at the core of our business, and we align the entire company around our customers’ needs, promoting their success, showing our value and upholding applicable laws, contractual obligations and industry regulations and standards. Innovation is fundamental to our mission, empowering and enabling our customers to stay ahead in their industries and driving technological advancements in line with evolving laws, standards and guidelines. Equality is a legal and ethical mandate and a core tenet that informs how we operate. Our commitment to equal opportunity is anchored in applicable laws, statutes, regulations and principles. We value the equality of every individual at our company and in our communities and are dedicated to fostering a workplace that complies with these protections, creating an inclusive culture where every individual feels seen, heard and valued. Finally, we are committed to creating a more sustainable and nature-positive future for all. Our products and services help our customers meet their own sustainability and compliance priorities, guided by applicable environmental and sustainability-related laws, corporate social responsibility frameworks and legal requirements. By grounding our values in legal and regulatory principles, we reinforce our opportunity and responsibility to uphold high integrity and robust ethical standards, ensuring that trust, fairness, and compliance remain central to everything we seek to do.\nWe believe that our values, grounded in legal and regulatory frameworks, create value, and the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including stockholders, customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. Salesforce is committed to giving back to our communities, helping businesses grow while protecting the environment for future generations, and transparent environmental, social and governance disclosures. We believe we have a broad responsibility to society, and we aspire to create a framework for the ethical and humane use of technology that not only drives the success of our customers, but also upholds the basic human rights of every individual.\nOur Service Offerings\nWe believe that every business, in every industry, has to optimize for an AI-first experience for their customers, employees and partners, leveraging trusted AI, data and CRM technology to increase efficiency, boost productivity and drive growth.

The Salesforce Platform is built on Hyperforce, our infrastructure that helps customers manage data governance and compliance at a local level, all over the world. Our technology partners help customers to easily add the applications they need and utilize the data lakes and systems they have already invested in, and because the platform is open source, customers can integrate and build with any data or partner application they choose to make the platform work for their business.\nSlack. \nOur Slack offering is a workplace communication and productivity platform where work happens for millions of people every day.

We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. We orient our business strategy and invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities:\nExpand relationships with existing customers.\n We see significant opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships through cross-selling and upselling our service offerings. For example, we continue to focus on driving multiple service offering adoption, which provides our customers with a one-stop-shop for their front-office business technology needs. As our customers realize the benefits of our entire suite of service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customers’ experience with new products and features and gain additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units. Finally, we aim to expand our relationships with existing customers through our additional support offerings.\nIncrease geographic reach. \nBy extending our go-to-market capabilities globally, we aim to grow our business by selling to new customers in new regions. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in most major markets globally. We also plan to continue to develop distribution channels through new and existing marketplaces and partners for our solutions around the globe and new go-to-market strategies. We continue to invest in our domestic and international operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world.\nFocus on industries and new products. \nAs part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative and value-driven solutions in new categories based on our existing and potential customers’ needs. For example, we provide out-of-the-box solutions specifically built for customers in certain industries, such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing and more. In addition, through direct discussions and strategic engagements with our customers, we are able to deliver the innovations and enhancements that align with the needs of our customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform for deploying autonomous AI agents across any business function. Agentforce includes a set of tools to create and customize AI agents, as well as a library of ready-to-use skills for any use case across sales, service, marketing and commerce, Tableau, Slack, partners and more. \nLeverage our partner ecosystem. \nThe Salesforce Platform enables customers, independent software vendors (“ISVs”) and third-party developers to create, test and deliver cloud-based applications. These applications can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by software vendors. In addition, we rely on our consulting partners to deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, from large-scale implementations to more limited solutions that help businesses run more efficiently. We continue to work with and invest in our partner ecosystem, including these ISVs and system integrators (“SIs”), to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries.\nPromote strong customer adoption and reduce customer attrition. \nWe believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. Our customer success programs, including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists, help enable and accelerate our customers’ digital transformations. In addition, we have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies learn our systems and a community of Trailblazers who drive innovation. With these programs and resources, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions.\nMergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our Salesforce Platform. Our evaluation seeks to confirm that any potential acquisition accelerates our strategy, represents an attractive customer opportunity, provides a pathway to effectively monetize the acquired products and drive significant operational efficiencies and presents a clear timeline for value accretion. Our acquisitions can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and accelerate development of features to large-scale acquisitions that result in new service offerings. Our goal is to prioritize the use of our balance sheet, through cash and debt, to complete acquisitions.\nWe also manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and SIs. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company’s initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, including AI. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find attractive, including investments in companies representing targeted businesses, technological initiatives and geographies. Our strategy includes growing our strategic investment portfolio, in part, by reinvesting proceeds from the sales of strategic investments.\n7\nTable of Contents\nTechnology, Development and Operations\nWe primarily deliver our solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. This approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality and enhancing existing offerings.\nWe provide our services through cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking, as well as through infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities. We continue to invest and expand the deployment of Hyperforce, which allows our platform and applications to be delivered rapidly and reliably to locations worldwide and provides our customers autonomy and control over data residency.\nOur technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing service offerings, as well as developing new features, functionality and services. We also remain focused on integrating businesses, services and technologies from acquisitions. Performance, functional depth, security, usability, ease of integration and configuration and sustainability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction.\nCompetition\nThe market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology with low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services.\nOur current competitors include:\n•\nvendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise applications delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;\n•\nsoftware companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization;\n•\nvendors who offer software tailored to specific services, industries or market segments, as opposed to our full suite of service offerings including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors, e-commerce solutions vendors, or AI software and service vendors;\n•\nproductivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market; and\n•\ntraditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications, including AI augmented applications, that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services, as well as would-be customers who may develop enterprise applications for internal use.\nWe believe more companies may become competitive threats due to the attractiveness of the markets in which we operate. We also expect our competition to change and evolve as we expand into more markets, with new offerings.\nCustomers\nWe sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues in fiscal years 2025, 2024 or 2023. In addition, we do not have any material dependencies on any specific product, service or particular group or groups.\nCustomer Service and Support\nWe offer professional services to help customers achieve business results faster with Salesforce solutions. Our architects and innovation program teams act as advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers. This includes implementation services for multi-offering and complex deployments. We provide best-practices and AI-based recommendations and adoption programs globally. In addition, we provide advanced education, including in-person and online courses, to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our service offerings.\nOur global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours to customers as part of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium success offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support and system administration. In addition, we offer a premier priority support add-on that includes proactive monitoring, rapid incident response and instruction from a dedicated support team knowledgeable about the customer's specific \n8\nTable of Contents\nenterprise architecture. With the launch of Agentforce, we’ve made it easier for customers to find answers by providing an even more intuitive experience on our Salesforce Help page. Agentforce can resolve customer issues swiftly and accurately because answers are grounded in our trusted unstructured content unified in Data Cloud. By automating simple and repetitive tasks, our support engineers will be able to augment and scale their time in a more valuable way.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which comprises sales personnel based in regional hubs, field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers and self-service offerings.\nTo a lesser extent, we also utilize a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and assist in selling to prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, SIs and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription services.\nWe use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities in the cities and countries with the largest market opportunities. Our primary marketing activities include:\n•\nmultichannel marketing campaigns that span email, social media, the web, television and more, which align to a broader customer journey;\n•\nin-person and virtual customer events of all sizes to create customer and prospect awareness, including proprietary events such as Dreamforce and our virtual Dreamforce to You, World Tours and other virtual events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events;\n•\nlive events and original programming on our Salesforce+ streaming service, which includes discussions about the future of technology in the AI-first, work anywhere world and educational content to learn new skills and pursue new career opportunities;\n•\npress and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, brand, service offerings and value proposition;\n•\npartner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners;\n•\ncustomer testimonials and our community of Trailblazers: individuals who drive innovation, grow their careers and transform their businesses using the Salesforce Platform;\n•\nin-person and virtual technology event sponsorships; and\n•\nevent partnerships with high-profile global brands and organizations.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally should be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms.\nHuman Capital Management \nSalesforce is committed to a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability. These core values are the foundation of our company culture, which we believe is fundamental to, and a competitive advantage in, our approach to managing our workforce. We believe our company culture fosters open dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of belonging, all of which allow us to attract and retain the best talent, which is critical for our continued success. For example, our sales, engineering and customer success teams are critical to our ability to grow, innovate, and promote the trust and success of our customers.\nWe believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective. Our focus on our workplace environment and a strong company culture has led to recognition across the globe, as evidenced by the following awards: Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies (2024 and for the 15th time), One of America's Most JUST Companies from JUST Capital (2025 and for the eighth year in a row), Fortune World's Most Admired Companies (2025 for the 11th year in a row), Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For (2024 and for the 16th year in a row), Fortune World’s Most Innovative Companies (2024, for the second year in a row), a Top 100 Employer of Choice on the American Opportunity Index (2024 and for the third year in a row), A Glassdoor Best Places to Work 2025, a 2024 Great Place to Work Best Workplace in: Japan, UK, South Korea, Argentina, France, Spain, Denmark, Canada, United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Ireland, The Netherlands, India, Portugal, \n9\nTable of Contents\nBrazil, Singapore, Australia and a Built In’s 2025 Best Places to Work winner in: Dallas, Colorado, Austin, Seattle, Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco and a 100 Best U.S. Large Companies to Work For in 2025 overall. \nAs of January 31, 2025, we had 76,453 employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. However, employees of certain foreign subsidiaries are represented by works councils.\nWe have continued to invest in development programs, employee engagement and ongoing communications and feedback. For additional information on our workforce, refer to our annual Stakeholder Impact Report, https://salesforce.com/stakeholder-impact-report. Some of our key human capital management initiatives are summarized below:\nEquality\nOur approach to equality is firmly rooted in compliance with federal law (as a U.S. company) and other applicable laws and regulations in the regions in which we operate, including statutes, regulations and principles governing equal pay, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination protections. These legal frameworks shape our long-standing commitment to fostering a workplace where all individuals are treated equally, have access to opportunities and are protected from discrimination. By adhering to these laws, we uphold a fair and inclusive environment where our employees can do the best work and teaming of their careers, reinforcing principles of equality, dignity and respect for all.\nTalent and Career Development\nWe offer our employees various talent development programs to create a culture of continuous learning and new ways to grow their careers. We provide learning and development opportunities through Career Connect, our internal talent marketplace, and Trailhead, our learning platform available for all employees. We encourage our employees to seek personal and professional development opportunities with external organizations and offer yearly education reimbursement to employees who wish to continue job-related education from accredited institutions or organizations.\nTotal Rewards\nWe believe offering competitive compensation packages and robust benefits is an important factor in our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees and to help enhance their everyday wellbeing. We use a combination of fixed and variable cash compensation for all employees and award equity compensation to certain employees in the form of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, and on a limited basis, stock options. Eligible employees are also able to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows employees to purchase our stock at a 15 percent discount up to U.S. Internal Revenue Code limits. We also match up to $5,000 of donations, per employee, to eligible nonprofit organizations, and effective February 1, 2025, donations are matched up to $10,000 per employee. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local legal requirements and to be competitive in the marketplace.\nOur V2MOM and Code of Conduct\nAlignment and consistent and clear communication are a key part of our employee engagement, especially as we continue to grow. Each year, we complete a corporate V2MOM, which is our business plan for the year used to align the Company on our vision, values, methods, obstacles and measures for the upcoming year. All employees are then expected to complete their own V2MOM that aligns with the corporate V2MOM. In addition, our Code of Conduct reflects our core values, which remain the foundation of the Company and which directly impact our ability to deliver success. We expect all of our employees to act with integrity, including treating others with compassion and respect.\nEmployee Engagement and Satisfaction\nOur leadership strives for active engagement with our employees through a variety of channels, including all-company meetings and our daily newsletter, The Daily, allowing employees to stay connected with the business and new developments. Twice a year, all employees have the opportunity to complete a confidential survey measuring employee engagement and experience, the health of our culture and how we are living up to our values. This survey is one of several ways we see to understand employee experience and drive real change across the Company. \nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate globally and are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Additional information regarding governmental regulations relevant to our business is discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and all amendments to these filings, can be obtained free of charge from our website at http://investor.salesforce.com/financials/ or by contacting our Investor Relations department at our office address listed above as soon as reasonably practicable following our filing of any of these reports with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business and operations, growth, reputation, prospects, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. Some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other events, factors or uncertainties that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, other key metrics and the trading price of our common stock. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. \nRisk Factor Summary\nOperational and Execution Risks\n•\nAny breaches in our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying

management.\nGeneral Risks\n•\nVolatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions.\n•\nThe occurrence of natural disasters and other events beyond our control.\n•\nThe long-term impact of climate change on our business.\nOperational and Execution Risks\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the Internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure and liabilities, or a negative financial impact.\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial, health and other personal information. Our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following:\n•\nthird-party attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our customers’ data or IT systems, or our data or our IT systems;\n•\nefforts by hackers or sophisticated groups, such as criminal organizations, state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, to launch coordinated cyberattacks on internally built infrastructure or on third-party cloud-computing platform providers, including ransomware, destructive malware and distributed denial-of-service attacks;\n•\nthird-party attempts to abuse our marketing, advertising, messaging or social products and functionalities to impersonate persons or organizations and disseminate information that is false, misleading or malicious;\n•\nvulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired companies, or resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings;\n•\nvulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on;\n•\nattacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners or customers; and\n12\nTable of Contents\n•\nemployee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems.\nThese risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies and enhance processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. We can provide no assurances that our security measures, including implemented systems and processes designed to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data, will provide absolute security or otherwise be effective or that a material breach will not occur. For example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following: \n•\nevolving techniques used to breach or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure, including as a result of the increased use of AI technologies by bad actors, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques;\n•\nthe increasing complexity of our internal IT systems as we incorporate and secure IT environments from acquired companies and early adoption of new technologies and new ways of sharing data; and\n•\nour limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers (including those authorized by customers to access their data), or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.\nIn the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattacks and have experienced other security incidents. Although, to date, such identified security events have not had a material financial impact, there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. Additionally, as our market presence grows, we may face increased risks of cyberattacks or security threats, and as AI technologies, including generative AI models, develop rapidly, threat actors are using these technologies to create new sophisticated attack methods that are increasingly automated, targeted and coordinated and more difficult to defend against.\nA security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our IT systems or data, or our customers’ systems or data, including intellectual property and proprietary, sensitive or other confidential information. We have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. For example, SEC rules require disclosure on Form 8-K of the nature, scope and timing of any material cybersecurity incident and the reasonably likely impact of any such incident. A security breach or resulting mandatory disclosure could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal, regulatory and financial exposure and liability. Further, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from a cybersecurity incident or breach of our IT systems. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable, may not be straightforward and may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities. \nDefects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe have in the past and may in the future find defects in or experience disruptions to our services. Such issues may arise in a variety of circumstances, including due to our customers using our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data; as a result of employee, contractor or other third-party action or inaction; or due to the complexity of our services, which incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party and open-source software. Across the industry, cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We may also encounter difficulties integrating acquired or licensed technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies we use to meet quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation, which may result in our services containing errors or defects. \nWe have experienced and may in the future experience defects in our products that create vulnerabilities that inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. We can provide no assurance that such product defects or other vulnerabilities will not occur in the future, have a material adverse effect on our business or subject us to substantial liability. Vulnerabilities in open source or any proprietary or third-party product can persist even after security patches have been issued if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching was complete. In some cases, vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to damaged assets. \nSince our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems have in the past adversely impacted our customers’ businesses and could do so in the future. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\n13\nTable of Contents\nAny interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, as well as internet availability, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe currently rely on third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries, as well as the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet, to deliver our products, services and business operations and to operate critical business systems. We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of third-party providers we rely on, could result in service interruptions and harm our business. We have from time to time experienced service interruptions and such interruptions may occur in the future. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, particularly with respect to third-party cloud computing platforms, our exposure to damage from service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may increase. Service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.\nFor many of our offerings, our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in a separate facility located elsewhere. Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of destruction or vandalism or similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. In addition, supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical developments in Europe may lead to power disruptions in regions where our facilities are located. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or risks, or a natural disaster or public health emergency, an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems or operational failures at these facilities could result in lengthy service interruptions, and no assurance can be provided that any such interruptions would be remediated without significant cost or in a timely manner or at all.\nThe hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms that we rely on, including, for example, the large language models leveraged in our AI offerings, may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software, data or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and disrupt or otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services, and no assurance can be provided that such equivalent technology would be developed or obtained in a timely manner or at all.\nAs we scale our operations, the amount and type of information transferred on our offerings continues to evolve, including as a result of the deployment of AI technologies, and our infrastructure capacity requirements, including network capacity and computing power, may increase as a result. If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our reputation and business. As we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we move or transfer our data and our customers’ data from time to time. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.\nAs we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to make such acquisitions in the future. \nAcquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including:\n•\npotential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all;\n•\npotential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings, as well as difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology;\n14\nTable of Contents\n•\ndifficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; \n•\nbrand or reputational harm associated with our acquired companies;\n•\nchallenges converting the acquired company’s revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues, including both consumption- and subscription-based revenues and term software license revenue, as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables;\n•\nchallenges entering into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n•\ncurrency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets;\n•\noperational and financial difficulties and strains on resources in integrating acquired operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;\n•\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay or impose conditions (such as divestitures, ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the completion of transactions or the integration of acquired operations;\n•\nfailure to fully assimilate, integrate or retrain acquired employees, which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams or our workplace culture;\n•\nchallenges with maintaining the acquired company’s customers, partners and third-party service providers;\n•\nknown and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, including due to litigation;\n•\ndifficulties in managing, or potential write-offs of, acquired assets, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; \n•\nnegative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets;\n•\ndifficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure;\n•\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition, including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations;\n•\nineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; and\n•\nthe tax effects related to integration and business operation changes, realizability of our deferred tax assets, and uncertain tax liabilities. \nAny of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, to facilitate acquisitions, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, or integrate acquired businesses effectively, may be impaired by trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions in the technology sector. For example, several countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions of varying kinds on transactions involving foreign investments and acquisitions. Antitrust authorities in a number of countries have also reviewed acquisitions in the technology industry with increased scrutiny. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, some of which may apply to acquisitions or integrations of businesses by us, and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nWe continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, including through acquisitions, which has placed a strain on and in the future may strain our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that significant additional investments, including in human capital software, as well as leveraging agentic AI and other technologies, will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth. These investments will increase our cost base, making it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the \n15\nTable of Contents\nshort term. We may not be able to make these investments as quickly or effectively as necessary to successfully scale our operations.\nWe regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems and processes or in migrating away from our existing systems and processes, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. \nOur success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to plan and manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. Additionally, changes in our work environment and workforce may not meet the needs and expectations of our workforce or may create operational and workplace culture challenges, which could negatively impact our ability to increase employee productivity or attract and retain our employees and could adversely affect our operations. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline.\nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer. If customer usage of certain consumption-based offerings is below expected levels, our revenue could decline. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates or optimal pricing for consumption-based contracts, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. \nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services, particularly in times of general economic uncertainty. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of various factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers’ spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes, such as the increased prevalence of consumption-based pricing models and economic downturns. \nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and customer receptiveness to any price changes related to these additional features and services.\nIn addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumption-based contracts.\nPeriodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.\nWe periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Such sales organization changes have in some periods resulted in, and may in the future result in, a reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth in the current and future quarters and operating results, including revenue. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. \nSales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations.\nWe sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. We intend to seek to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States or those that can affect international operations generally, include:\n•\nregional economic and political conditions, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergencies; \n•\nlocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n•\nregulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors;\n16\nTable of Contents\n•\npressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;\n•\nforeign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to or negatively impact our operating results;\n•\ncompliance with complex and evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, anti-corruption, import/export, customs, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, antitrust, cybersecurity, sustainability and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers;\n•\nliquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations;\n•\nvetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation;\n•\ntreatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments and changes to tax codes, including being subject to and paying withholding taxes under foreign tax laws;\n•\nuncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in trade policies, including trade wars, tariffs or other trade restrictions or the threat of such actions, or other geopolitical events, including the evolving relations between the United States and China, the United States and Russia, and ongoing conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East;\n•\nperceptions of regions or governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate, resulting in negative publicity or reputational harm;\n•\nregional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers’ data across international borders;\n•\ndifferent pricing environments;\n•\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n•\ndifferent or lesser protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, and more prevalent cybersecurity risks, particularly in jurisdictions in which we have historically chosen not to operate; and\n•\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties.\nAny of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed.\nAs more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.\nAs we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, and specific industries, such as financial services and healthcare and life sciences, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In these market segments, the customer’s decision to use our services is often an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, may require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally.\nIn addition, larger customers and governmental entities often demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities often require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.\nPricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for our existing and future service offerings, including for our AI offerings such as Agentforce, may not be widely accepted by new or existing customers. We offer certain products, such as Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based pricing model, and we have limited experience with determining the optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect may result in suboptimal \n17\nTable of Contents\npricing for consumption-based contracts. Our adoption of or failure to adopt, as well as the manner and time of, changes to our pricing and packaging models and strategies may harm our business.\nWe may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. Our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. Effective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success, and changes in our management team resulting from the hiring, departure or realignment of executives may be disruptive to our business. If we do not develop adequate succession planning for our key personnel, the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business. \nThe technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and technology services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. We have experienced challenges with significant competition in talent recruitment and retention, and may not in the future be successful in recruiting or retaining such talent. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. Additionally, our compensation arrangements and benefits may not always be successful in attracting new employees or retaining and motivating our existing personnel. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. \nIn January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth, which included a reduction of our workforce and office space reductions within certain markets. The workforce reduction was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024, and real estate actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2026. Additionally, throughout fiscal 2025 we initiated further targeted workforce and office space reductions. These restructuring actions, or any similar actions taken in the future, could negatively impact our ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate key employees.\nIn addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition, equality and a sense of family. As our organization has grown and expanded globally, and as our workplace plans have developed, including workforce and office space reductions related to our restructuring actions, we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties maintaining our corporate culture globally, including managing the complexities of communicating with all employees. Any inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, harm our reputation with customers or negatively impact our future growth.\nAny failure in the delivery of high-quality professional and technical support services related to our online applications may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nOur customers sometimes require highly skilled and trained service professionals to successfully implement our applications and depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. Implementation services may be performed by us, our customers, a third party, or a combination thereof. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If customers are not satisfied with the quality and timing of work by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, our revenue recognition could be impacted and the customer’s dissatisfaction with the services received could negatively impact our ability to sell our other offerings to that customer or retain existing customers. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customers. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain high-quality professional and technical support services could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. \nStrategic and Industry Risks\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to a different enterprise software service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.\nOur current competitors include:\n•\nvendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise applications delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;\n•\nsoftware companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization;\n•\nvendors who offer software tailored to specific services, industries or market segments, as opposed to our full suite of service offerings, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors, e-commerce solutions vendors or AI software and service vendors;\n•\nproductivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market; and\n•\ntraditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications, including AI-augmented applications, that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services, as well as would-be customers who may develop enterprise applications for internal use.\nIn addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings. Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers’ demands and offer more targeted and simplified solutions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or provide competitive pricing, more flexible contracts or faster implementations. Additionally, as we continue to increase building AI into many of our offerings, we face more competition as AI technologies are increasingly integrated into the markets in which we compete. New AI offerings may disrupt workforce needs and negatively impact demand for our offerings, or our competitors may be able to incorporate AI into their offerings more efficiently or successfully than we are able to and achieve greater and faster adoption. Even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business.\nOur efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.\nOur efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. In addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumption-based contracts. Further, the introduction of future platform changes and upgrades may not result in long term revenue growth. \nIf we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including its timely completion, introduction and market acceptance, as well as our ability to integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. In addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a \n19\nTable of Contents\nvariety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms, we need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in these technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely.\nAdditionally, if we fail to timely anticipate or identify significant technology trends and developments, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. Uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, modifications to existing platforms or technologies, including text messaging capabilities, or changes in customer usage patterns thereof could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. \nOur continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.\nWe believe that the brand identities we have developed, including associations with trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands is critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength, particularly for our core services, depends largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and to continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services and features in a secure, reliable manner that enhances our customers’ success even as we scale and expand our services. In order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands, we have made and may in the future make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services, or we may enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. \nIn addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand.\nFurther, entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact our ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. \nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital. Significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could negatively impact our financial results. \nWe manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. While we invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, advancing responsible generative AI, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, we may still experience unforeseen brand or reputational harm associated with our investments. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company’s initial public offering. Investments in early stage companies are inherently speculative, as these companies may not yet be revenue-generating and could still be in the process of developing their products and services at the time of our investment. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. Our investments may face challenges from regulatory authorities, including antitrust authorities, potentially resulting in unexpected costs, delays, or unfavorable conditions imposed on transactions involving our investment portfolio. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.\nWe are exposed to volatility in our operating results due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments of our strategic investments. The measurement of our non-marketable equity and debt securities at fair value is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation. The resulting gains or losses could be material depending on market conditions and events, particularly in periods with economic uncertainty, inflation, geopolitical conflict, volatile public equity markets or unsettled global market conditions.\nIf third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed.\nOur success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security or integrity of the data access, transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to \n20\nTable of Contents\nsupport and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our reputation and our business.\nSocial and ethical issues, including the use or capabilities of AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability.\nPolicies we adopt or choose not to adopt on social and ethical issues, especially regarding the use of our products, may be unpopular with some of our employees or with our customers or potential customers, and have in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers. Our decisions about whether to conduct business with potential customers, or whether to continue or expand business with existing customers, may also impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers, and could result in negative publicity or reputational harm. Further, actions taken by our customers and employees, including through the use or misuse of our products or new technologies for illegal activities or improper information sharing, may result in reputational harm or possible liability, particularly in light of regulatory requirements like the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) from the EU. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe that we have a strong defense against these allegations, legal proceedings can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations and the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of outcome, these types of claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. \nWe are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings, including generative and agentic AI. As with many innovations, AI offerings, such as Agentforce, and our Salesforce Platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. For example, the development of our AI offerings and the Salesforce Platform, which provides information regarding our customers’ customers, present emerging ethical issues. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability, especially as geopolitical turmoil creates increasingly volatile political and market conditions. Inadequate or ineffective AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions or result in unintended performance of the services. This in turn could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analysis or other content that our AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation and AI agents will require additional investment in compliance, governance and the licensing or development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly and could impact our profit margin. Moreover, the move from AI content classification to AI content generation through our development of Agentforce and other generative AI products brings additional risks and responsibility. Known risks of generative AI currently include risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy and security and data provenance. For example, AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed, or contains copyrighted or other protected material, and if our customers or others use this flawed or protected content to their detriment, or the owners of such copyrighted material seek to enforce their rights, we may be exposed to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm and/or legal liability. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems. If we are unable to mitigate these risks, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. \nThe evolving landscape related to ESG matters may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\nEquality and sustainability are core values of the Company. In furtherance of these values, we have in the past and may in the future establish and disclose quantitative and qualitative statements related to ESG matters, which are aspirational and subject to numerous risks and dependencies. The proliferation of regulations addressing climate, human capital and other ESG topics at the regional, state, national and international levels has required and may continue to require significant effort and resources, and our practices, processes and controls may not ensure compliance with evolving standards. Further, various regulations may conflict with each other, making universal compliance challenging as a multinational company, and our status as a government contractor in various jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. where we are headquartered, may also result in greater exposure or differentiated obligations or requirements with which we would seek to comply. The standards and frameworks for tracking and reporting on ESG matters continue to evolve, and our use, interpretation or application of such frameworks and standards may change from time to time or differ from those of other companies, which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between Salesforce and other companies. In addition, our ESG practices and disclosures may not satisfy, appropriately respond to the concerns of or be supported by all investors, customers, partners, regulators, enforcement authorities or other stakeholders (including those in support of and those in \n21\nTable of Contents\nopposition to various ESG practices), whose expectations and requirements are evolving and varied. Any violation of, non-compliance with or failure to meet such expectations or requirements, or negative publicity related to our ESG practices or disclosures, could result in harm to our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or service provider, could expose us to increased scrutiny or criticism or to regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation, and could cause us to incur increased costs to address or defend against such actions. \nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nPrivacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, AI services, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.\nRegulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the collection, processing, storage, hosting, transfer and use of data, generally. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), impose obligations directly on us as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), and laws that have recently passed and/or gone into effect in many other states similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both a covered business and service provider. These laws continue to evolve, including, for example, India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, and as various jurisdictions introduce similar proposals, which often include subsequent rules and regulation, we and our customers become subject to additional regulatory burdens. New EU laws, including the DSA, the Data Act and the AI Act, may impose additional rules and restrictions on the use of our products and services. \nIn addition, various safe harbors have historically been provided to those who hosted content provided by others, such as safe harbors from monetary damages for copyright infringement arising from copyrighted content provided by customers and others and for defamation and other torts arising from information provided by customers and others. There is an increasing demand for repealing or limiting these safe harbors by either judicial decision or legislation, and we have active legal proceedings that have been impacted by the repeal or limiting of safe harbors that were previously available to us. Loss of these safe harbors may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers’ misconduct.\nAlthough we monitor the regulatory, judicial and legislative environment and have invested in addressing these developments, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance, including as a result of penalties, fines and lawsuits related to data breaches. Furthermore, privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements are causing increased scrutiny among customers, particularly in the public sector and highly regulated industries, and may be perceived differently from customer to customer. These developments could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers’ ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, one of the mechanisms that allowed companies, including us, to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to the United States. Even though the CJEU decision upheld the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as an adequate transfer mechanism, the decision created uncertainty around the validity of all EU-to-U.S. data transfers. While the EU and U.S. governments have since adopted the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to foster EU-to-U.S. data transfers and address the concerns raised in the aforementioned CJEU decision, it is uncertain whether this framework will be overturned in court like the previous two EU-U.S. bilateral cross-border transfer frameworks. As a result, regulators may continue to be inclined to interpret the CJEU’s decision, and the logic behind it, as significantly restricting certain cross-border transfers and the cost and complexity of providing our services in certain markets may increase. Certain countries outside of the EEA have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency. By way of further example, statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under the CCPA, may increase our and our customers’ potential liability and the demands our customers place on us.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from our commitments to customers and our customers’ customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws, any of which could harm our business.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. For example, in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch citizens that claims we violated the GDPR and Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our Audience Studio and Data Studio products. In December 2021, the Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective’s claims against us inadmissible and dismissed the case, however, this ruling was appealed by the Privacy Collective. The appeal hearing took place in the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in February 2024 and the appellate court reversed the district court’s judgment. We have appealed that appellate decision to the Dutch Supreme Court. We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK, which has subsequently been dismissed. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. In addition, a shift in consumers’ data privacy expectations or other social, economic or political developments could impact the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and increase the cost of compliance with the imposed regulations. \nFurthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. In addition, new products we develop or acquire in connection with changing events may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\nIndustry-specific regulations and other requirements and standards are evolving and industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.\nOur customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing, AI services and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Any inability in the future to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers may harm our business and adversely affect our results.\nFurther, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized “in country,” as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. This is also true with respect to the global proliferation of laws regulating the financial services industry, including its use of cloud services. In Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which aims to ensure the resilience of the EU financial sectors, including through mandatory risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and third-party outsourcing restrictions, went into effect in January 2025. The UK is advancing similar legislation and other countries may follow. \nFurther, countries and states are applying their data and consumer protection laws to AI, and particularly generative AI, and/or are enacting or considering legal frameworks on AI, such as the Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act and the draft CCPA regulations on automated decision-making technology. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThere are various statutes, regulations and rulings relevant to direct email marketing and text-messaging, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) and related Federal Communication Commission orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the TCPA. A determination that we or our customers violated the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In addition, many jurisdictions across the world are currently considering, or have already begun implementing, changes to antitrust and competition laws, regulations or interpretative positions to enhance competition in digital markets and address practices by certain digital platforms that they perceive to be anticompetitive. These regulatory efforts could result in laws, regulations or interpretative positions that may require us to change certain of our business practices, undertake new compliance obligations or otherwise may have an adverse impact on our business and results. \nWe have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims, including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.\nWe are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, antitrust, data privacy, cybersecurity and other matters.\nThe software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of many patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We have also been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.\nIn addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our customers, including through the use or misuse of our products. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. \nOur exposure to risks associated with various claims may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we are subject to ongoing securities class action litigation and related stockholder derivative claims brought against Slack that remain outstanding, and as to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement costs. Additionally, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to acquired companies or technologies. In addition, third parties have made claims in connection with our acquisitions and may do so in the future, and they may also make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nThe outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims or lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.\nAny adverse determination or settlement could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results, including our operating cash flow in a particular period. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAny failure to obtain registration or protection of our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harm our business.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have many U.S. patents and pending U.S. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive \n24\nTable of Contents\nadvantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Similar uncertainty applies to our U.S. and international trademark registrations and applications. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. and elsewhere. Additionally, the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies, which we are increasingly building into our product offerings, has not been fully addressed by U.S. courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of AI technologies in our products and services may expose us to copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation claims related to AI training or output. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available and legal changes and uncertainty in various countries’ intellectual property regimes may result in making conduct that we believe is lawful to be deemed violative of others’ rights. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard-setting activity, our contribution to open source projects, various competition law regimes or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property in certain circumstances. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. Furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources from our core business, and harm our business.\nWe may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations.\nContracting with federal, state, local and foreign governments or state-owned entities subjects us to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to these contracts’ formation, administration and performance, and how we engage with government officials. We are from time to time subject to audits, inquiries and investigations relating to our government contracts, which may result in adverse perceptions of our business, reductions in utilization of our services or termination of our contracts without cause and at any time. Additionally, any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our contracting with certain government entities may result in negative publicity or reputational harm. Any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales, costs of doing business and operating results.\nWe are subject to governmental sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and may subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. \nOur solutions are subject to trade control laws and regulations where we conduct our business activities, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations, U.S. customs regulations, U.S. supply chain regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with applicable trade control laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of trade privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining necessary authorizations, including any required licenses, may be time-consuming, requires expenditure of corporate resources, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or the ability to realize value from certain acquisitions or engagements. Acquisitions may also subject us to successor liability and other integration compliance risks. Furthermore, export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations may prohibit or limit the transfer of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and parties. We can provide no assurance that any of the precautions we take to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations will be effective, and, accordingly, our solutions could be provisioned or provided to those targets, including by our resellers or other third parties, which could have negative consequences for our business, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or trade control laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sanctions and export and import control regulations in the United States and other countries are subject to change and uncertainty, including as a result of rapidly evolving technology, increased government regulation of AI and cloud service solutions, and geopolitical developments such as events affecting relations between the United States and China, multi-jurisdictional sanctions on Russia, the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East. Regulators in the United States and elsewhere have signaled an increased emphasis on sanctions and export control enforcement, including efforts to combat diversion of services to sanctioned countries and parties, several recent high-profile enforcement actions and increased pressure for companies to self-disclose potential violations.\n25\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Risks\nBecause we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term.\nIf we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nDue to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, including from the global economic impact of ongoing conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East; the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services; the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy; changing interest rates and inflation; the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from term software license sales; and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. We plan our expense and investment levels based on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations, and unanticipated events may cause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. Additionally, if sales through indirect channels or for consumption-based product offerings increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting revenue and anticipated rate of growth. As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. If we are not able to provide continued operating margin expansion, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and global tax developments may impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in operations, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in the tax effects of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions and changes in accounting principles and tax laws. Any changes, ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities. \nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state, local or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, or changes to our business operations, including as a result of acquisitions. Any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.\nWe are also subject to tax examinations or engaged in alternative resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial position.\nAs our business continues to grow, increasing our brand recognition and profitability, we may be subject to increased scrutiny and corresponding tax disputes, which may impact our cash flows and financial results. Furthermore, our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile, and if perceived negatively, may cause brand or reputational harm.\nGlobal tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business, cash flows, or financial results. Such developments, for example, may include certain provisions introduced by certain Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s proposals including the implementation of the global minimum tax under the Pillar Two model rules, and the European Commission’s and certain major jurisdictions’ heightened interest in and taxation of \n26\nTable of Contents\ncompanies participating in the digital economy. Furthermore, governments’ responses to macroeconomic factors and tax revenue needs may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results. \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies. \nWe primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.\nAdditionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East, fluctuating commodity prices, uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and inflation, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes. We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $5.0 billion Credit Facility. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025, we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\nIn addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, including leases that have not yet commenced and commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. \nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:\n•\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n•\ncause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments; and \n•\nmake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business. \nIn addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact our reputation, the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in \n27\nTable of Contents\nevents of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. Any required repayment of our debt as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.\nLease accounting guidance requires that we record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet, which increases both our assets and liabilities and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability and associated asset only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. We reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. The potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial position and financial results.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially.\nOur quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. Fluctuations have occurred due to known and unknown risks, such as the global economic impact of ongoing conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East, and uncertainty about the interest rate environment. In addition, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter has typically in the past been our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.\nAdditionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n•\ngeneral economic or geopolitical conditions, including the impacts of the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East; financial market conditions; uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in trade policies, including trade wars, tariffs or other trade restrictions or the threat of such actions; and increasing costs of operation;\n•\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements, including large enterprise customers;\n•\nthe attrition rates for our services;\n•\nthe size and productivity of our workforce, as well as the cost to recruit and train new employees;\n•\nthe length of the sales cycle for our services;\n•\nnew product and service introductions by our competitors;\n•\nchanges in unearned revenue and remaining performance obligation;\n•\nour ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments;\n•\nour ability to execute and realize benefits from restructuring actions and other workforce reductions, or any similar actions taken in the future;\n•\nvariations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our subscription and support offerings;\n•\nthe seasonality of our sales cycle, as well as timing of contract execution and term software license sales;\n•\nthe lack of certainty regarding customer usage and associated costs for consumption-based product offerings;\n•\nchanges in and expenses associated with our pricing policies and terms of contracts;\n•\nthe seasonality of our customers’ businesses, especially our Commerce service offering customers; \n•\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;\n•\nthe timing of commission, bonus and other compensation payments to employees; \n•\nthe cost, timing and management effort required for the introduction of new features to our services;\n•\nthe costs associated with acquiring and integrating new businesses and technologies;\n•\nexpenses related to our real estate or changes in the nature or extent of our use of existing real estate, including our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion;\n•\ntiming of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services;\n•\nexpenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur, including litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n28\nTable of Contents\n•\nincome tax effects resulting from, but not limited to, tax law changes, court decisions on tax matters, global tax developments applicable to multinational corporations, changes in operations or business structures and acquisition activity;\n•\nthe timing of stock awards to employees and payroll and other withholding tax expenses;\n•\ntechnical difficulties or service interruptions;\n•\nchanges in interest rates and our mix of investments, which impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities;\n•\nchanges in the fair value of our strategic investments, including changes due to impairments, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations; \n•\nequity or debt issuances, including as consideration in or in conjunction with acquisitions;\n•\nevolving regulations of cloud computing, AI and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; and\n•\nregulatory compliance and acquisition costs.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might negatively and materially impact our operating results. If we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n•\nvariations in our financial results and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\n•\nvariations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business;\n•\nforward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future operating results, the accuracy of which may be impacted by various factors, many of which are beyond our control;\n•\nour ability to meet or exceed forward-looking guidance we have given or to meet or exceed the expectations of investors, analysts or others; our ability to give forward-looking guidance consistent with past practices;\n•\nchanges to previous guidance or long-range targets, in the estimates of our operating results or in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n•\nannouncements or rumors of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances, mergers or other strategic acquisitions or significant agreements by us or within our industry;\n•\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n•\nthe coverage of our common stock by the financial media;\n•\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n•\ndisruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;\n•\nthe economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, including global trade and health concerns, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers, and financial institution instability;\n•\ntrading activity or positions by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, as well as other institutional or activist investors;\n•\nour ability to execute on our Share Repurchase Program as planned, including whether we meet internal or external expectations around the timing or price of share repurchases, and any changes to the program;\n•\nissuance of equity, debt or other convertible securities; \n•\nany increase to or reduction, suspension or elimination of dividend payments;\n•\nthe inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;\n•\nchanges to our credit ratings; and\n•\nissues impacting our reputation. \nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the greater securities market in general experience uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock has and could in the future decline for reasons unrelated to us, including as a reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry. Some companies that have experienced volatility \n29\nTable of Contents\nin the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation, such as the securities litigation against Slack that was brought before our acquisition. Such litigation, whether against us or an acquired subsidiary, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources and any liability resulting from or the settlement of such litigation could result in material adverse impacts to our operating cash flows or results of operations for a given period.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in our management that the stockholders of the Company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:\n•\npermit the Board to establish the number of directors;\n•\nauthorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a “poison pill”);\n•\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n•\nprovide that the Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n•\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts, or at all.\nWhether we continue to pay cash dividends, as well as the rate at which we pay cash dividends, in the future is subject to continued capital availability, general economic and market conditions, applicable laws and agreements and our Board continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The declaration and payment of any dividend may be discontinued at any time and dividend amounts may be reduced at any time. A discontinuation of or reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.", "word_count": 23252, "token_count": 27480, "start_char": 153219, "end_char": 310193, "local_heads": [], "metadata_snapshot": {"doctype": "10-K", "date": "2015-08-31", "topic": "Agentforce|Data Cloud|Earnings|Partnership|Product", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm", "title": "crm-20250131", "company": "Salesforce", "persona_tags": ["cio", "vp_customer_experience", "vp_sales_ops"]}}

We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. We orient our business strategy and invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities:\nExpand relationships with existing customers.\n We see significant opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships through cross-selling and upselling our service offerings. For example, we continue to focus on driving multiple service offering adoption, which provides our customers with a one-stop-shop for their front-office business technology needs. As our customers realize the benefits of our entire suite of service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customers’ experience with new products and features and gain additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units. Finally, we aim to expand our relationships with existing customers through our additional support offerings.\nIncrease geographic reach. \nBy extending our go-to-market capabilities globally, we aim to grow our business by selling to new customers in new regions. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in most major markets globally. We also plan to continue to develop distribution channels through new and existing marketplaces and partners for our solutions around the globe and new go-to-market strategies. We continue to invest in our domestic and international operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world.\nFocus on industries and new products. \nAs part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative and value-driven solutions in new categories based on our existing and potential customers’ needs. For example, we provide out-of-the-box solutions specifically built for customers in certain industries, such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing and more. In addition, through direct discussions and strategic engagements with our customers, we are able to deliver the innovations and enhancements that align with the needs of our customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform for deploying autonomous AI agents across any business function. Agentforce includes a set of tools to create and customize AI agents, as well as a library of ready-to-use skills for any use case across sales, service, marketing and commerce, Tableau, Slack, partners and more. \nLeverage our partner ecosystem. \nThe Salesforce Platform enables customers, independent software vendors (“ISVs”) and third-party developers to create, test and deliver cloud-based applications. These applications can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by software vendors. In addition, we rely on our consulting partners to deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, from large-scale implementations to more limited solutions that help businesses run more efficiently. We continue to work with and invest in our partner ecosystem, including these ISVs and system integrators (“SIs”), to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries.\nPromote strong customer adoption and reduce customer attrition. \nWe believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. Our customer success programs, including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists, help enable and accelerate our customers’ digital transformations. In addition, we have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies learn our systems and a community of Trailblazers who drive innovation. With these programs and resources, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions.\nMergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our Salesforce Platform. Our evaluation seeks to confirm that any potential acquisition accelerates our strategy, represents an attractive customer opportunity, provides a pathway to effectively monetize the acquired products and drive significant operational efficiencies and presents a clear timeline for value accretion. Our acquisitions can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and accelerate development of features to large-scale acquisitions that result in new service offerings. Our goal is to prioritize the use of our balance sheet, through cash and debt, to complete acquisitions.\nWe also manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and SIs. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company’s initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, including AI. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find attractive, including investments in companies representing targeted businesses, technological initiatives and geographies. Our strategy includes growing our strategic investment portfolio, in part, by reinvesting proceeds from the sales of strategic investments.\n7\nTable of Contents\nTechnology, Development and Operations\nWe primarily deliver our solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. This approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality and enhancing existing offerings.\nWe provide our services through cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking, as well as through infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities. We continue to invest and expand the deployment of Hyperforce, which allows our platform and applications to be delivered rapidly and reliably to locations worldwide and provides our customers autonomy and control over data residency.\nOur technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing service offerings, as well as developing new features, functionality and services. We also remain focused on integrating businesses, services and technologies from acquisitions. Performance, functional depth, security, usability, ease of integration and configuration and sustainability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction.\nCompetition\nThe market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology with low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services.\nOur current competitors include:\n•\nvendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise applications delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;\n•\nsoftware companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization;\n•\nvendors who offer software tailored to specific services, industries or market segments, as opposed to our full suite of service offerings including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors, e-commerce solutions vendors, or AI software and service vendors;\n•\nproductivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market; and\n•\ntraditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications, including AI augmented applications, that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services, as well as would-be customers who may develop enterprise applications for internal use.\nWe believe more companies may become competitive threats due to the attractiveness of the markets in which we operate. We also expect our competition to change and evolve as we expand into more markets, with new offerings.\nCustomers\nWe sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues in fiscal years 2025, 2024 or 2023. In addition, we do not have any material dependencies on any specific product, service or particular group or groups.\nCustomer Service and Support\nWe offer professional services to help customers achieve business results faster with Salesforce solutions. Our architects and innovation program teams act as advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers. This includes implementation services for multi-offering and complex deployments. We provide best-practices and AI-based recommendations and adoption programs globally. In addition, we provide advanced education, including in-person and online courses, to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our service offerings.\nOur global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours to customers as part of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium success offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support and system administration. In addition, we offer a premier priority support add-on that includes proactive monitoring, rapid incident response and instruction from a dedicated support team knowledgeable about the customer's specific \n8\nTable of Contents\nenterprise architecture. With the launch of Agentforce, we’ve made it easier for customers to find answers by providing an even more intuitive experience on our Salesforce Help page. Agentforce can resolve customer issues swiftly and accurately because answers are grounded in our trusted unstructured content unified in Data Cloud. By automating simple and repetitive tasks, our support engineers will be able to augment and scale their time in a more valuable way.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which comprises sales personnel based in regional hubs, field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers and self-service offerings.\nTo a lesser extent, we also utilize a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and assist in selling to prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, SIs and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription services.\nWe use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities in the cities and countries with the largest market opportunities. Our primary marketing activities include:\n•\nmultichannel marketing campaigns that span email, social media, the web, television and more, which align to a broader customer journey;\n•\nin-person and virtual customer events of all sizes to create customer and prospect awareness, including proprietary events such as Dreamforce and our virtual Dreamforce to You, World Tours and other virtual events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events;\n•\nlive events and original programming on our Salesforce+ streaming service, which includes discussions about the future of technology in the AI-first, work anywhere world and educational content to learn new skills and pursue new career opportunities;\n•\npress and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, brand, service offerings and value proposition;\n•\npartner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners;\n•\ncustomer testimonials and our community of Trailblazers: individuals who drive innovation, grow their careers and transform their businesses using the Salesforce Platform;\n•\nin-person and virtual technology event sponsorships; and\n•\nevent partnerships with high-profile global brands and organizations.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally should be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms.\nHuman Capital Management \nSalesforce is committed to a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability. These core values are the foundation of our company culture, which we believe is fundamental to, and a competitive advantage in, our approach to managing our workforce. We believe our company culture fosters open dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of belonging, all of which allow us to attract and retain the best talent, which is critical for our continued success. For example, our sales, engineering and customer success teams are critical to our ability to grow, innovate, and promote the trust and success of our customers.\nWe believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective. Our focus on our workplace environment and a strong company culture has led to recognition across the globe, as evidenced by the following awards: Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies (2024 and for the 15th time), One of America's Most JUST Companies from JUST Capital (2025 and for the eighth year in a row), Fortune World's Most Admired Companies (2025 for the 11th year in a row), Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For (2024 and for the 16th year in a row), Fortune World’s Most Innovative Companies (2024, for the second year in a row), a Top 100 Employer of Choice on the American Opportunity Index (2024 and for the third year in a row), A Glassdoor Best Places to Work 2025, a 2024 Great Place to Work Best Workplace in: Japan, UK, South Korea, Argentina, France, Spain, Denmark, Canada, United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Ireland, The Netherlands, India, Portugal, \n9\nTable of Contents\nBrazil, Singapore, Australia and a Built In’s 2025 Best Places to Work winner in: Dallas, Colorado, Austin, Seattle, Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco and a 100 Best U.S. Large Companies to Work For in 2025 overall. \nAs of January 31, 2025, we had 76,453 employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. However, employees of certain foreign subsidiaries are represented by works councils.\nWe have continued to invest in development programs, employee engagement and ongoing communications and feedback. For additional information on our workforce, refer to our annual Stakeholder Impact Report, https://salesforce.com/stakeholder-impact-report. Some of our key human capital management initiatives are summarized below:\nEquality\nOur approach to equality is firmly rooted in compliance with federal law (as a U.S. company) and other applicable laws and regulations in the regions in which we operate, including statutes, regulations and principles governing equal pay, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination protections. These legal frameworks shape our long-standing commitment to fostering a workplace where all individuals are treated equally, have access to opportunities and are protected from discrimination. By adhering to these laws, we uphold a fair and inclusive environment where our employees can do the best work and teaming of their careers, reinforcing principles of equality, dignity and respect for all.\nTalent and Career Development\nWe offer our employees various talent development programs to create a culture of continuous learning and new ways to grow their careers. We provide learning and development opportunities through Career Connect, our internal talent marketplace, and Trailhead, our learning platform available for all employees. We encourage our employees to seek personal and professional development opportunities with external organizations and offer yearly education reimbursement to employees who wish to continue job-related education from accredited institutions or organizations.\nTotal Rewards\nWe believe offering competitive compensation packages and robust benefits is an important factor in our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees and to help enhance their everyday wellbeing. We use a combination of fixed and variable cash compensation for all employees and award equity compensation to certain employees in the form of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, and on a limited basis, stock options. Eligible employees are also able to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows employees to purchase our stock at a 15 percent discount up to U.S. Internal Revenue Code limits. We also match up to $5,000 of donations, per employee, to eligible nonprofit organizations, and effective February 1, 2025, donations are matched up to $10,000 per employee. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local legal requirements and to be competitive in the marketplace.\nOur V2MOM and Code of Conduct\nAlignment and consistent and clear communication are a key part of our employee engagement, especially as we continue to grow. Each year, we complete a corporate V2MOM, which is our business plan for the year used to align the Company on our vision, values, methods, obstacles and measures for the upcoming year. All employees are then expected to complete their own V2MOM that aligns with the corporate V2MOM. In addition, our Code of Conduct reflects our core values, which remain the foundation of the Company and which directly impact our ability to deliver success. We expect all of our employees to act with integrity, including treating others with compassion and respect.\nEmployee Engagement and Satisfaction\nOur leadership strives for active engagement with our employees through a variety of channels, including all-company meetings and our daily newsletter, The Daily, allowing employees to stay connected with the business and new developments. Twice a year, all employees have the opportunity to complete a confidential survey measuring employee engagement and experience, the health of our culture and how we are living up to our values. This survey is one of several ways we see to understand employee experience and drive real change across the Company. \nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate globally and are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Additional information regarding governmental regulations relevant to our business is discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and all amendments to these filings, can be obtained free of charge from our website at http://investor.salesforce.com/financials/ or by contacting our Investor Relations department at our office address listed above as soon as reasonably practicable following our filing of any of these reports with the SEC.

service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the Internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure and liabilities, or a negative financial impact.\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial, health and other personal information. Our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following:\n•\nthird-party attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our customers’ data or IT systems, or our data or our IT systems;\n•\nefforts by hackers or sophisticated groups, such as criminal organizations, state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, to launch coordinated cyberattacks on internally built infrastructure or on third-party cloud-computing platform providers, including ransomware, destructive malware and distributed denial-of-service attacks;\n•\nthird-party attempts to abuse our marketing, advertising, messaging or social products and functionalities to impersonate persons or organizations and disseminate information that is false, misleading or malicious;\n•\nvulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired companies, or resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings;\n•\nvulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on;\n•\nattacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners or customers; and\n12\nTable of Contents\n•\nemployee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems.\nThese risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies and enhance processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. We can provide no assurances that our security measures, including implemented systems and processes designed to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data, will provide absolute security or otherwise be effective or that a material breach will not occur. For example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following: \n•\nevolving techniques used to breach or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure, including as a result of the increased use of AI technologies by bad actors, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques;\n•\nthe increasing complexity of our internal IT systems as we incorporate and secure IT environments from acquired companies and early adoption of new technologies and new ways of sharing data; and\n•\nour limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers (including those authorized by customers to access their data), or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.\nIn the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattacks and have experienced other security incidents. Although, to date, such identified security events have not had a material financial impact, there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. Additionally, as our market presence grows, we may face increased risks of cyberattacks or security threats, and as AI technologies, including generative AI models, develop rapidly, threat actors are using these technologies to create new sophisticated attack methods that are increasingly automated, targeted and coordinated and more difficult to defend against.\nA security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our IT systems or data, or our customers’ systems or data, including intellectual property and proprietary, sensitive or other confidential information. We have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. For example, SEC rules require disclosure on Form 8-K of the nature, scope and timing of any material cybersecurity incident and the reasonably likely impact of any such incident. A security breach or resulting mandatory disclosure could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal, regulatory and financial exposure and liability. Further, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from a cybersecurity incident or breach of our IT systems. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable, may not be straightforward and may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities. \nDefects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe have in the past and may in the future find defects in or experience disruptions to our services. Such issues may arise in a variety of circumstances, including due to our customers using our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data; as a result of employee, contractor or other third-party action or inaction; or due to the complexity of our services, which incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party and open-source software. Across the industry, cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We may also encounter difficulties integrating acquired or licensed technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies we use to meet quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation, which may result in our services containing errors or defects. \nWe have experienced and may in the future experience defects in our products that create vulnerabilities that inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. We can provide no assurance that such product defects or other vulnerabilities will not occur in the future, have a material adverse effect on our business or subject us to substantial liability. Vulnerabilities in open source or any proprietary or third-party product can persist even after security patches have been issued if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching was complete. In some cases, vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to damaged assets. \nSince our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems have in the past adversely impacted our customers’ businesses and could do so in the future. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\n13\nTable of Contents\nAny interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, as well as internet availability, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe currently rely on third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries, as well as the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet, to deliver our products, services and business operations and to operate critical business systems. We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of third-party providers we rely on, could result in service interruptions and harm our business. We have from time to time experienced service interruptions and such interruptions may occur in the future. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, particularly with respect to third-party cloud computing platforms, our exposure to damage from service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may increase. Service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.\nFor many of our offerings, our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in a separate facility located elsewhere. Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of destruction or vandalism or similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. In addition, supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical developments in Europe may lead to power disruptions in regions where our facilities are located. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or risks, or a natural disaster or public health emergency, an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems or operational failures at these facilities could result in lengthy service interruptions, and no assurance can be provided that any such interruptions would be remediated without significant cost or in a timely manner or at all.\nThe hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms that we rely on, including, for example, the large language models leveraged in our AI offerings, may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software, data or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and disrupt or otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services, and no assurance can be provided that such equivalent technology would be developed or obtained in a timely manner or at all.\nAs we scale our operations, the amount and type of information transferred on our offerings continues to evolve, including as a result of the deployment of AI technologies, and our infrastructure capacity requirements, including network capacity and computing power, may increase as a result. If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our reputation and business. As we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we move or transfer our data and our customers’ data from time to time. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.\nAs we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to make such acquisitions in the future. \nAcquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including:\n•\npotential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all;\n•\npotential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings, as well as difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology;\n14\nTable of Contents\n•\ndifficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; \n•\nbrand or reputational harm associated with our acquired companies;\n•\nchallenges converting the acquired company’s revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues, including both consumption- and subscription-based revenues and term software license revenue, as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables;\n•\nchallenges entering into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n•\ncurrency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets;\n•\noperational and financial difficulties and strains on resources in integrating acquired operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;\n•\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay or impose conditions (such as divestitures, ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the completion of transactions or the integration of acquired operations;\n•\nfailure to fully assimilate, integrate or retrain acquired employees, which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams or our workplace culture;\n•\nchallenges with maintaining the acquired company’s customers, partners and third-party service providers;\n•\nknown and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, including due to litigation;\n•\ndifficulties in managing, or potential write-offs of, acquired assets, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; \n•\nnegative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets;\n•\ndifficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure;\n•\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition, including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations;\n•\nineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; and\n•\nthe tax effects related to integration and business operation changes, realizability of our deferred tax assets, and uncertain tax liabilities. \nAny of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, to facilitate acquisitions, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, or integrate acquired businesses effectively, may be impaired by trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions in the technology sector. For example, several countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions of varying kinds on transactions involving foreign investments and acquisitions. Antitrust authorities in a number of countries have also reviewed acquisitions in the technology industry with increased scrutiny. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, some of which may apply to acquisitions or integrations of businesses by us, and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nWe continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, including through acquisitions, which has placed a strain on and in the future may strain our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that significant additional investments, including in human capital software, as well as leveraging agentic AI and other technologies, will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth. These investments will increase our cost base, making it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the \n15\nTable of Contents\nshort term. We may not be able to make these investments as quickly or effectively as necessary to successfully scale our operations.\nWe regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems and processes or in migrating away from our existing systems and processes, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. \nOur success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to plan and manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. Additionally, changes in our work environment and workforce may not meet the needs and expectations of our workforce or may create operational and workplace culture challenges, which could negatively impact our ability to increase employee productivity or attract and retain our employees and could adversely affect our operations. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline.\nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer. If customer usage of certain consumption-based offerings is below expected levels, our revenue could decline. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates or optimal pricing for consumption-based contracts, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. \nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services, particularly in times of general economic uncertainty. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of various factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers’ spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes, such as the increased prevalence of consumption-based pricing models and economic downturns. \nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and customer receptiveness to any price changes related to these additional features and services.\nIn addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumption-based contracts.\nPeriodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.\nWe periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Such sales organization changes have in some periods resulted in, and may in the future result in, a reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth in the current and future quarters and operating results, including revenue. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. \nSales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations.\nWe sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. We intend to seek to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States or those that can affect international operations generally, include:\n•\nregional economic and political conditions, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergencies; \n•\nlocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n•\nregulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors;\n16\nTable of Contents\n•\npressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;\n•\nforeign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to or negatively impact our operating results;\n•\ncompliance with complex and evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, anti-corruption, import/export, customs, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, antitrust, cybersecurity, sustainability and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers;\n•\nliquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations;\n•\nvetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation;\n•\ntreatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments and changes to tax codes, including being subject to and paying withholding taxes under foreign tax laws;\n•\nuncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in trade policies, including trade wars, tariffs or other trade restrictions or the threat of such actions, or other geopolitical events, including the evolving relations between the United States and China, the United States and Russia, and ongoing conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East;\n•\nperceptions of regions or governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate, resulting in negative publicity or reputational harm;\n•\nregional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers’ data across international borders;\n•\ndifferent pricing environments;\n•\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n•\ndifferent or lesser protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, and more prevalent cybersecurity risks, particularly in jurisdictions in which we have historically chosen not to operate; and\n•\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties.\nAny of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed.\nAs more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.\nAs we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, and specific industries, such as financial services and healthcare and life sciences, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In these market segments, the customer’s decision to use our services is often an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, may require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally.\nIn addition, larger customers and governmental entities often demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities often require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.\nPricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for our existing and future service offerings, including for our AI offerings such as Agentforce, may not be widely accepted by new or existing customers. We offer certain products, such as Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based pricing model, and we have limited experience with determining the optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect may result in suboptimal \n17\nTable of Contents\npricing for consumption-based contracts. Our adoption of or failure to adopt, as well as the manner and time of, changes to our pricing and packaging models and strategies may harm our business.\nWe may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. Our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. Effective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success, and changes in our management team resulting from the hiring, departure or realignment of executives may be disruptive to our business. If we do not develop adequate succession planning for our key personnel, the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business. \nThe technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and technology services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. We have experienced challenges with significant competition in talent recruitment and retention, and may not in the future be successful in recruiting or retaining such talent. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. Additionally, our compensation arrangements and benefits may not always be successful in attracting new employees or retaining and motivating our existing personnel. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. \nIn January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth, which included a reduction of our workforce and office space reductions within certain markets. The workforce reduction was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024, and real estate actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2026. Additionally, throughout fiscal 2025 we initiated further targeted workforce and office space reductions. These restructuring actions, or any similar actions taken in the future, could negatively impact our ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate key employees.\nIn addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition, equality and a sense of family. As our organization has grown and expanded globally, and as our workplace plans have developed, including workforce and office space reductions related to our restructuring actions, we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties maintaining our corporate culture globally, including managing the complexities of communicating with all employees. Any inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, harm our reputation with customers or negatively impact our future growth.\nAny failure in the delivery of high-quality professional and technical support services related to our online applications may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nOur customers sometimes require highly skilled and trained service professionals to successfully implement our applications and depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. Implementation services may be performed by us, our customers, a third party, or a combination thereof. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If customers are not satisfied with the quality and timing of work by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, our revenue recognition could be impacted and the customer’s dissatisfaction with the services received could negatively impact our ability to sell our other offerings to that customer or retain existing customers. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customers. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain high-quality professional and technical support services could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. \nStrategic and Industry Risks\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to a different enterprise software service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.\nOur current competitors include:\n•\nvendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise applications delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;\n•\nsoftware companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization;\n•\nvendors who offer software tailored to specific services, industries or market segments, as opposed to our full suite of service offerings, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors, e-commerce solutions vendors or AI software and service vendors;\n•\nproductivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market; and\n•\ntraditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications, including AI-augmented applications, that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services, as well as would-be customers who may develop enterprise applications for internal use.\nIn addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings. Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers’ demands and offer more targeted and simplified solutions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or provide competitive pricing, more flexible contracts or faster implementations. Additionally, as we continue to increase building AI into many of our offerings, we face more competition as AI technologies are increasingly integrated into the markets in which we compete. New AI offerings may disrupt workforce needs and negatively impact demand for our offerings, or our competitors may be able to incorporate AI into their offerings more efficiently or successfully than we are able to and achieve greater and faster adoption. Even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business.\nOur efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.\nOur efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. In addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumption-based contracts. Further, the introduction of future platform changes and upgrades may not result in long term revenue growth. \nIf we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including its timely completion, introduction and market acceptance, as well as our ability to integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. In addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a \n19\nTable of Contents\nvariety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms, we need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in these technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely.\nAdditionally, if we fail to timely anticipate or identify significant technology trends and developments, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. Uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, modifications to existing platforms or technologies, including text messaging capabilities, or changes in customer usage patterns thereof could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. \nOur continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.\nWe believe that the brand identities we have developed, including associations with trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands is critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength, particularly for our core services, depends largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and to continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services and features in a secure, reliable manner that enhances our customers’ success even as we scale and expand our services. In order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands, we have made and may in the future make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services, or we may enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. \nIn addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand.\nFurther, entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact our ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. \nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital. Significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could negatively impact our financial results. \nWe manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. While we invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, advancing responsible generative AI, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, we may still experience unforeseen brand or reputational harm associated with our investments. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company’s initial public offering. Investments in early stage companies are inherently speculative, as these companies may not yet be revenue-generating and could still be in the process of developing their products and services at the time of our investment. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. Our investments may face challenges from regulatory authorities, including antitrust authorities, potentially resulting in unexpected costs, delays, or unfavorable conditions imposed on transactions involving our investment portfolio. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.\nWe are exposed to volatility in our operating results due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments of our strategic investments. The measurement of our non-marketable equity and debt securities at fair value is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation. The resulting gains or losses could be material depending on market conditions and events, particularly in periods with economic uncertainty, inflation, geopolitical conflict, volatile public equity markets or unsettled global market conditions.\nIf third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed.\nOur success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security or integrity of the data access, transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to \n20\nTable of Contents\nsupport and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our reputation and our business.\nSocial and ethical issues, including the use or capabilities of AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability.\nPolicies we adopt or choose not to adopt on social and ethical issues, especially regarding the use of our products, may be unpopular with some of our employees or with our customers or potential customers, and have in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers. Our decisions about whether to conduct business with potential customers, or whether to continue or expand business with existing customers, may also impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers, and could result in negative publicity or reputational harm. Further, actions taken by our customers and employees, including through the use or misuse of our products or new technologies for illegal activities or improper information sharing, may result in reputational harm or possible liability, particularly in light of regulatory requirements like the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) from the EU. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe that we have a strong defense against these allegations, legal proceedings can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations and the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of outcome, these types of claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. \nWe are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings, including generative and agentic AI. As with many innovations, AI offerings, such as Agentforce, and our Salesforce Platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. For example, the development of our AI offerings and the Salesforce Platform, which provides information regarding our customers’ customers, present emerging ethical issues. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability, especially as geopolitical turmoil creates increasingly volatile political and market conditions. Inadequate or ineffective AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions or result in unintended performance of the services. This in turn could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analysis or other content that our AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation and AI agents will require additional investment in compliance, governance and the licensing or development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly and could impact our profit margin. Moreover, the move from AI content classification to AI content generation through our development of Agentforce and other generative AI products brings additional risks and responsibility. Known risks of generative AI currently include risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy and security and data provenance. For example, AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed, or contains copyrighted or other protected material, and if our customers or others use this flawed or protected content to their detriment, or the owners of such copyrighted material seek to enforce their rights, we may be exposed to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm and/or legal liability. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems. If we are unable to mitigate these risks, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. \nThe evolving landscape related to ESG matters may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\nEquality and sustainability are core values of the Company. In furtherance of these values, we have in the past and may in the future establish and disclose quantitative and qualitative statements related to ESG matters, which are aspirational and subject to numerous risks and dependencies. The proliferation of regulations addressing climate, human capital and other ESG topics at the regional, state, national and international levels has required and may continue to require significant effort and resources, and our practices, processes and controls may not ensure compliance with evolving standards. Further, various regulations may conflict with each other, making universal compliance challenging as a multinational company, and our status as a government contractor in various jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. where we are headquartered, may also result in greater exposure or differentiated obligations or requirements with which we would seek to comply. The standards and frameworks for tracking and reporting on ESG matters continue to evolve, and our use, interpretation or application of such frameworks and standards may change from time to time or differ from those of other companies, which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between Salesforce and other companies. In addition, our ESG practices and disclosures may not satisfy, appropriately respond to the concerns of or be supported by all investors, customers, partners, regulators, enforcement authorities or other stakeholders (including those in support of and those in \n21\nTable of Contents\nopposition to various ESG practices), whose expectations and requirements are evolving and varied. Any violation of, non-compliance with or failure to meet such expectations or requirements, or negative publicity related to our ESG practices or disclosures, could result in harm to our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or service provider, could expose us to increased scrutiny or criticism or to regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation, and could cause us to incur increased costs to address or defend against such actions. \nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nPrivacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, AI services, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.\nRegulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the collection, processing, storage, hosting, transfer and use of data, generally. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), impose obligations directly on us as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), and laws that have recently passed and/or gone into effect in many other states similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both a covered business and service provider. These laws continue to evolve, including, for example, India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, and as various jurisdictions introduce similar proposals, which often include subsequent rules and regulation, we and our customers become subject to additional regulatory burdens. New EU laws, including the DSA, the Data Act and the AI Act, may impose additional rules and restrictions on the use of our products and services. \nIn addition, various safe harbors have historically been provided to those who hosted content provided by others, such as safe harbors from monetary damages for copyright infringement arising from copyrighted content provided by customers and others and for defamation and other torts arising from information provided by customers and others. There is an increasing demand for repealing or limiting these safe harbors by either judicial decision or legislation, and we have active legal proceedings that have been impacted by the repeal or limiting of safe harbors that were previously available to us. Loss of these safe harbors may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers’ misconduct.\nAlthough we monitor the regulatory, judicial and legislative environment and have invested in addressing these developments, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance, including as a result of penalties, fines and lawsuits related to data breaches. Furthermore, privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements are causing increased scrutiny among customers, particularly in the public sector and highly regulated industries, and may be perceived differently from customer to customer. These developments could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers’ ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, one of the mechanisms that allowed companies, including us, to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to the United States. Even though the CJEU decision upheld the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as an adequate transfer mechanism, the decision created uncertainty around the validity of all EU-to-U.S. data transfers. While the EU and U.S. governments have since adopted the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to foster EU-to-U.S. data transfers and address the concerns raised in the aforementioned CJEU decision, it is uncertain whether this framework will be overturned in court like the previous two EU-U.S. bilateral cross-border transfer frameworks. As a result, regulators may continue to be inclined to interpret the CJEU’s decision, and the logic behind it, as significantly restricting certain cross-border transfers and the cost and complexity of providing our services in certain markets may increase. Certain countries outside of the EEA have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency. By way of further example, statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under the CCPA, may increase our and our customers’ potential liability and the demands our customers place on us.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from our commitments to customers and our customers’ customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws, any of which could harm our business.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. For example, in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch citizens that claims we violated the GDPR and Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our Audience Studio and Data Studio products. In December 2021, the Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective’s claims against us inadmissible and dismissed the case, however, this ruling was appealed by the Privacy Collective. The appeal hearing took place in the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in February 2024 and the appellate court reversed the district court’s judgment. We have appealed that appellate decision to the Dutch Supreme Court. We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK, which has subsequently been dismissed. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. In addition, a shift in consumers’ data privacy expectations or other social, economic or political developments could impact the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and increase the cost of compliance with the imposed regulations. \nFurthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. In addition, new products we develop or acquire in connection with changing events may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\nIndustry-specific regulations and other requirements and standards are evolving and industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.\nOur customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing, AI services and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Any inability in the future to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers may harm our business and adversely affect our results.\nFurther, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized “in country,” as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. This is also true with respect to the global proliferation of laws regulating the financial services industry, including its use of cloud services. In Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which aims to ensure the resilience of the EU financial sectors, including through mandatory risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and third-party outsourcing restrictions, went into effect in January 2025. The UK is advancing similar legislation and other countries may follow. \nFurther, countries and states are applying their data and consumer protection laws to AI, and particularly generative AI, and/or are enacting or considering legal frameworks on AI, such as the Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act and the draft CCPA regulations on automated decision-making technology. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThere are various statutes, regulations and rulings relevant to direct email marketing and text-messaging, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) and related Federal Communication Commission orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the TCPA. A determination that we or our customers violated the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In addition, many jurisdictions across the world are currently considering, or have already begun implementing, changes to antitrust and competition laws, regulations or interpretative positions to enhance competition in digital markets and address practices by certain digital platforms that they perceive to be anticompetitive. These regulatory efforts could result in laws, regulations or interpretative positions that may require us to change certain of our business practices, undertake new compliance obligations or otherwise may have an adverse impact on our business and results. \nWe have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims, including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.\nWe are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, antitrust, data privacy, cybersecurity and other matters.\nThe software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of many patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We have also been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.\nIn addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our customers, including through the use or misuse of our products. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. \nOur exposure to risks associated with various claims may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we are subject to ongoing securities class action litigation and related stockholder derivative claims brought against Slack that remain outstanding, and as to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement costs. Additionally, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to acquired companies or technologies. In addition, third parties have made claims in connection with our acquisitions and may do so in the future, and they may also make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nThe outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims or lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.\nAny adverse determination or settlement could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results, including our operating cash flow in a particular period. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAny failure to obtain registration or protection of our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harm our business.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have many U.S. patents and pending U.S. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive \n24\nTable of Contents\nadvantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Similar uncertainty applies to our U.S. and international trademark registrations and applications. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. and elsewhere. Additionally, the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies, which we are increasingly building into our product offerings, has not been fully addressed by U.S. courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of AI technologies in our products and services may expose us to copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation claims related to AI training or output. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available and legal changes and uncertainty in various countries’ intellectual property regimes may result in making conduct that we believe is lawful to be deemed violative of others’ rights. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard-setting activity, our contribution to open source projects, various competition law regimes or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property in certain circumstances. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. Furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources from our core business, and harm our business.\nWe may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations.\nContracting with federal, state, local and foreign governments or state-owned entities subjects us to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to these contracts’ formation, administration and performance, and how we engage with government officials. We are from time to time subject to audits, inquiries and investigations relating to our government contracts, which may result in adverse perceptions of our business, reductions in utilization of our services or termination of our contracts without cause and at any time. Additionally, any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our contracting with certain government entities may result in negative publicity or reputational harm. Any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales, costs of doing business and operating results.\nWe are subject to governmental sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and may subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. \nOur solutions are subject to trade control laws and regulations where we conduct our business activities, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations, U.S. customs regulations, U.S. supply chain regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with applicable trade control laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of trade privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining necessary authorizations, including any required licenses, may be time-consuming, requires expenditure of corporate resources, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or the ability to realize value from certain acquisitions or engagements. Acquisitions may also subject us to successor liability and other integration compliance risks. Furthermore, export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations may prohibit or limit the transfer of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and parties. We can provide no assurance that any of the precautions we take to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations will be effective, and, accordingly, our solutions could be provisioned or provided to those targets, including by our resellers or other third parties, which could have negative consequences for our business, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or trade control laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sanctions and export and import control regulations in the United States and other countries are subject to change and uncertainty, including as a result of rapidly evolving technology, increased government regulation of AI and cloud service solutions, and geopolitical developments such as events affecting relations between the United States and China, multi-jurisdictional sanctions on Russia, the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East. Regulators in the United States and elsewhere have signaled an increased emphasis on sanctions and export control enforcement, including efforts to combat diversion of services to sanctioned countries and parties, several recent high-profile enforcement actions and increased pressure for companies to self-disclose potential violations.\n25\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Risks\nBecause we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term.\nIf we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nDue to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, including from the global economic impact of ongoing conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East; the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services; the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy; changing interest rates and inflation; the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from term software license sales; and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. We plan our expense and investment levels based on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations, and unanticipated events may cause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. Additionally, if sales through indirect channels or for consumption-based product offerings increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting revenue and anticipated rate of growth. As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. If we are not able to provide continued operating margin expansion, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and global tax developments may impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in operations, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in the tax effects of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions and changes in accounting principles and tax laws. Any changes, ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities. \nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state, local or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, or changes to our business operations, including as a result of acquisitions. Any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.\nWe are also subject to tax examinations or engaged in alternative resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial position.\nAs our business continues to grow, increasing our brand recognition and profitability, we may be subject to increased scrutiny and corresponding tax disputes, which may impact our cash flows and financial results. Furthermore, our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile, and if perceived negatively, may cause brand or reputational harm.\nGlobal tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business, cash flows, or financial results. Such developments, for example, may include certain provisions introduced by certain Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s proposals including the implementation of the global minimum tax under the Pillar Two model rules, and the European Commission’s and certain major jurisdictions’ heightened interest in and taxation of \n26\nTable of Contents\ncompanies participating in the digital economy. Furthermore, governments’ responses to macroeconomic factors and tax revenue needs may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results. \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies. \nWe primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.\nAdditionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East, fluctuating commodity prices, uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and inflation, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes. We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $5.0 billion Credit Facility. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025, we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\nIn addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, including leases that have not yet commenced and commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. \nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:\n•\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n•\ncause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments; and \n•\nmake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business. \nIn addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact our reputation, the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in \n27\nTable of Contents\nevents of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. Any required repayment of our debt as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.\nLease accounting guidance requires that we record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet, which increases both our assets and liabilities and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability and associated asset only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. We reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. The potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial position and financial results.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially.\nOur quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. Fluctuations have occurred due to known and unknown risks, such as the global economic impact of ongoing conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East, and uncertainty about the interest rate environment. In addition, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter has typically in the past been our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.\nAdditionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n•\ngeneral economic or geopolitical conditions, including the impacts of the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East; financial market conditions; uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in trade policies, including trade wars, tariffs or other trade restrictions or the threat of such actions; and increasing costs of operation;\n•\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements, including large enterprise customers;\n•\nthe attrition rates for our services;\n•\nthe size and productivity of our workforce, as well as the cost to recruit and train new employees;\n•\nthe length of the sales cycle for our services;\n•\nnew product and service introductions by our competitors;\n•\nchanges in unearned revenue and remaining performance obligation;\n•\nour ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments;\n•\nour ability to execute and realize benefits from restructuring actions and other workforce reductions, or any similar actions taken in the future;\n•\nvariations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our subscription and support offerings;\n•\nthe seasonality of our sales cycle, as well as timing of contract execution and term software license sales;\n•\nthe lack of certainty regarding customer usage and associated costs for consumption-based product offerings;\n•\nchanges in and expenses associated with our pricing policies and terms of contracts;\n•\nthe seasonality of our customers’ businesses, especially our Commerce service offering customers; \n•\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;\n•\nthe timing of commission, bonus and other compensation payments to employees; \n•\nthe cost, timing and management effort required for the introduction of new features to our services;\n•\nthe costs associated with acquiring and integrating new businesses and technologies;\n•\nexpenses related to our real estate or changes in the nature or extent of our use of existing real estate, including our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion;\n•\ntiming of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services;\n•\nexpenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur, including litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n28\nTable of Contents\n•\nincome tax effects resulting from, but not limited to, tax law changes, court decisions on tax matters, global tax developments applicable to multinational corporations, changes in operations or business structures and acquisition activity;\n•\nthe timing of stock awards to employees and payroll and other withholding tax expenses;\n•\ntechnical difficulties or service interruptions;\n•\nchanges in interest rates and our mix of investments, which impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities;\n•\nchanges in the fair value of our strategic investments, including changes due to impairments, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations; \n•\nequity or debt issuances, including as consideration in or in conjunction with acquisitions;\n•\nevolving regulations of cloud computing, AI and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; and\n•\nregulatory compliance and acquisition costs.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might negatively and materially impact our operating results. If we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n•\nvariations in our financial results and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\n•\nvariations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business;\n•\nforward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future operating results, the accuracy of which may be impacted by various factors, many of which are beyond our control;\n•\nour ability to meet or exceed forward-looking guidance we have given or to meet or exceed the expectations of investors, analysts or others; our ability to give forward-looking guidance consistent with past practices;\n•\nchanges to previous guidance or long-range targets, in the estimates of our operating results or in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n•\nannouncements or rumors of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances, mergers or other strategic acquisitions or significant agreements by us or within our industry;\n•\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n•\nthe coverage of our common stock by the financial media;\n•\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n•\ndisruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;\n•\nthe economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, including global trade and health concerns, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers, and financial institution instability;\n•\ntrading activity or positions by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, as well as other institutional or activist investors;\n•\nour ability to execute on our Share Repurchase Program as planned, including whether we meet internal or external expectations around the timing or price of share repurchases, and any changes to the program;\n•\nissuance of equity, debt or other convertible securities; \n•\nany increase to or reduction, suspension or elimination of dividend payments;\n•\nthe inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;\n•\nchanges to our credit ratings; and\n•\nissues impacting our reputation. \nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the greater securities market in general experience uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock has and could in the future decline for reasons unrelated to us, including as a reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry. Some companies that have experienced volatility \n29\nTable of Contents\nin the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation, such as the securities litigation against Slack that was brought before our acquisition. Such litigation, whether against us or an acquired subsidiary, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources and any liability resulting from or the settlement of such litigation could result in material adverse impacts to our operating cash flows or results of operations for a given period.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in our management that the stockholders of the Company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:\n•\npermit the Board to establish the number of directors;\n•\nauthorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a “poison pill”);\n•\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n•\nprovide that the Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n•\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts, or at all.\nWhether we continue to pay cash dividends, as well as the rate at which we pay cash dividends, in the future is subject to continued capital availability, general economic and market conditions, applicable laws and agreements and our Board continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The declaration and payment of any dividend may be discontinued at any time and dividend amounts may be reduced at any time. A discontinuation of or reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\n\nGeneral Risks\nVolatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced significant economic and market downturns in the past, and are likely to experience additional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, inflation, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and other events beyond our control, such as war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East, have increased and may continue to increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and the volatility of global financial markets. Moreover, these conditions have affected and may continue to affect the rate of IT spending; could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services; have delayed and may delay customer purchasing decisions; and have reduced and may in the future reduce the value and duration of customer subscription contracts or cause our customers to seek to modify their existing subscription contracts. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales, attrition rates and operating results.\nGeopolitical crises, natural disasters and other events beyond our control have in the past and may in the future materially adversely affect us.\nGeopolitical crises, natural disasters or other catastrophic events have in the past and may in the future cause damage or disruption to our people, operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations, the business operations of third-party providers or suppliers that we rely on to conduct our business and the business operations of our customers are subject to interruption by geopolitical crises, natural disasters, fire, power or water shutoffs or shortages, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, actual or threatened public health emergencies and other events beyond our control. \n30\nTable of Contents\nFor example, the occurrence of regional conflicts, epidemics or a global pandemic have in the past and may in the future materially affect how we and our customers operate our businesses, as well as our operating results and cash flows. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our personnel, research and development activities and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event, and the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event. \nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing appropriate environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, there are inherent climate-related risks where our business is conducted. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, our offices globally have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, flooding, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with climate-related events. These events in turn have impacts on inflation risks, the cost and availability of insurance, food security, water security (including for water availability for data center cooling), energy security and on our employees’ health, productivity and well-being. Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees working remotely or at client sites. Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of companies we invest in, the business of third-party providers or suppliers that we rely on to conduct our business and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. In particular, climate-related events, energy market volatility, and power grid disruptions may increase the operational costs related to inputs across our value chain, including for data centers. Perceived associations with data centers’ growing energy demand or data center/AI-related changes to existing environmental pledges in certain jurisdictions may also result in increased targeting of our sites and operations by activists. Additionally, failure to uphold, meet or make timely forward progress against our public commitments and goals related to climate action could adversely impact the resilience of our business to the impacts of climate-related events.", "word_count": 23959, "token_count": 28169, "start_char": 310193, "end_char": 472016, "local_heads": [], "metadata_snapshot": {"doctype": "10-K", "date": "2015-08-31", "topic": "Agentforce|Data Cloud|Earnings|Partnership|Product", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm", "title": "crm-20250131", "company": "Salesforce", "persona_tags": ["cio", "vp_customer_experience", "vp_sales_ops"]}}

As such, we have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, the target of cybersecurity threats and other efforts to breach or compromise our services and underlying infrastructure. With trust as our foremost value and the foundation of everything we do, we recognize the importance of maintaining the safety and security of our systems and data.\nManagement is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Company’s cybersecurity policies, processes, practices and risk management. The Board, including through its dedicated Cybersecurity and Privacy committee (the “Committee”), oversees the various cybersecurity risks facing the Company and the Company’s efforts to mitigate those risks.\nDuring the last fiscal year, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that materially affected the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we face ongoing and increasing cybersecurity risks, including from bad actors that are becoming more sophisticated and effective over time, as well as a result of potential defects or disruptions in our or our customers’ services. If realized, these risks are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company.\n Additional information on the cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Part I, Items 1A-C, “Risk Factors.”\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWhen a company purchases our service offerings, they gain a trusted digital advisor who will work together with them in their efforts to protect their data. We aim to provide a secure and compliant enterprise cloud platform and we work to build trust and in-depth defense into all of our systems. Among other things, we employ an experienced team of cybersecurity professionals, engage in community events and offer free online cybersecurity incident prevention training to help enable our customers to focus on their business, knowing their data is safe and accessible as needed.\nWe seek to address material cybersecurity risks through a company-wide approach that assesses, ranks and prioritizes cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities and issues as they are identified to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems and the information that we collect and store. \nThe Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices are informed by recognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Organization for Standardization and an array of other applicable standards-setting bodies, which are integrated into a broader risk management framework and related processes.\n We also hold various security-related industry certifications and attestations that have been validated by external auditors, including SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, ISO 27001, 27017 and 27018, CSA STAR and others.\nLeveraging threat intelligence and other signals, the Company undergoes periodic testing, audits and reviews of its policies, standards, processes and practices to identify, assess and address cybersecurity risks and events. The Company also undergoes routine internal and external penetration testing. The results of such tests and assessments are evaluated by management and periodically reported to the Committee. The Company further adjusts its cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices based on these results and evolving industry practices. The Company also publishes attestations of its various certifications, audits, and penetration tests on its global compliance webpage.\nBoard Oversight and Governance\nAs mentioned above, the \nBoard\n established the Committee to provide dedicated oversight of cybersecurity-related management, strategy, initiatives, risks, threats and remediation activities.\n \nThe Committee receives regular presentations, reports and updates from the Company’s \nChief Trust Officer (“CTrO”) and other members of management\n on developments regarding the Company’s cybersecurity program, broader cybersecurity trends, evolving industry standards, the threat environment and other topics. After each quarterly meeting of the Committee, the Board receives a report from the Chair of the Committee with an update on the Company’s oversight of cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts. The Committee also receives periodic reports from an experienced outside consultant with information security expertise providing insights on key focus areas to aid in the Committee’s oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity program.\nThe Company’s processes also allow for the Board and the Committee to be informed of key cybersecurity risks outside the regular reporting schedule. While regular meetings of the Committee are scheduled on a quarterly cadence, the Committee is authorized to meet with management or individual directors at any time it deems appropriate to discuss matters relevant to the Committee. In between meetings, the Board and the Committee receive information regarding relevant cybersecurity risks \n32\nTable of Contents\n(including cybersecurity incidents) that meet pre-established reporting thresholds, as well as ongoing updates regarding any such risks.\nManagement Oversight and Governance\nThe CTrO, reporting to the Company’s Chief Engineering & Customer Success Officer (“C/E”), is responsible for designing and implementing a security program and strategy based on the mandate provided by the Board and senior management.\n \nThe CTrO has extensive experience in the management of cybersecurity risk programs, having served in various leadership roles in information technology and information security for over 15 years, including serving as the Chief Security Officer of two other large public technology companies. He also holds an undergraduate and master’s degree in computer science. We believe the Company’s business leaders, including our CEO, CFO, C/E and CLO, who have experience managing cybersecurity risk at the Company and at similar companies, have the appropriate expertise, background and depth of experience to manage risks arising from cybersecurity threats.\nThe CTrO, in coordination with other members of senior management, works collaboratively across the Company to implement a program designed to help protect the Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats and to promptly respond to cybersecurity incidents in accordance with the Company’s incident response and recovery plans. To facilitate the success of the Company’s cybersecurity program, cross-functional teams throughout the Company are tasked with addressing cybersecurity threats and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Through ongoing communications with these teams, the CTrO and senior management are able to be informed promptly about, and monitor the prevention, detection, investigation, mitigation and remediation of, cybersecurity threats. These teams are expected to operate pursuant to documented plans and playbooks that include processes for escalation of incidents to leadership and to the Committee and Board, as appropriate, based on the severity level of a cybersecurity incident. In addition, the Company periodically consults with outside advisors and experts to assist with assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, including to anticipate future threats and trends, and their impact on the Company’s risk management environment.\nSpecifically, management implements the Company’s cybersecurity and risk management strategy across several areas: \n \n•\nIdentification and Reporting\n. The Company has implemented a robust, cross-functional approach to identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity threats and risks. The Company’s program includes controls and procedures designed to properly identify, classify, and escalate cybersecurity risks and incidents to provide management with visibility and prioritization of risk mitigation efforts and to publicly report material cybersecurity incidents when appropriate. \n•\nThreat Intelligence\n. The Company maintains a Threat Intelligence team focused on profiling, intelligence collection, and threat analysis supporting the Company’s ongoing efforts to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity threats. The team’s input supports both near-term response to cybersecurity events, and long-term strategic planning and development of the Company’s cybersecurity risk management framework. \n•\nTechnical Safeguards\n. The Company implements technical safeguards that are designed to protect both the Company’s service offerings and other information systems we control from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality, vulnerability management, encryption processes and access controls, all of which are periodically evaluated and improved through risk and control assessments and in response to cybersecurity threat intelligence as well as outside audits and certifications. \n•\nIncident Response and Recovery Planning\n. The Company has established and maintains incident response, business continuity and disaster recovery plans designed to address the Company’s response to a cybersecurity incident, including the public disclosure and reporting of material incidents in a timely manner. These plans and procedures serve to guide and document a rigorous incident response program that reflects the roles of an array of stakeholders, including personnel providing technical, operational, engineering, legal and other perspectives across the Company. The Company conducts regular tabletop exercises involving multiple operational teams, including senior management, to test these plans and to familiarize personnel with their roles in a response scenario. \n•\nThird-Party Risk Management\n. The Company maintains a risk-based approach to identifying and \noverseeing cybersecurity threats presented by certain third parties\n, including vendors, service providers and other external users of the Company’s systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems. \n•\nEducation and Awareness\n. The Company regularly provides employee training on security-related duties and responsibilities, including knowledge about how to recognize cybersecurity incidents and how to proceed if an actual or suspected incident should occur. This training is mandatory for employees across the Company, and is intended to provide the Company’s employees with effective tools to address cybersecurity threats, and to communicate the Company’s evolving information security policies, standards, processes and practices. The Company maintains several \n33\nTable of Contents\nplans designed to prepare the Salesforce Security Response Center (SSRC) with the proper training, processes and capabilities needed to effectively respond to incidents.\nITEM 2.    PROPERTIES\nAs of January 31, 2025, our executive and principal offices for sales, marketing, professional services, development and administration consisted of approximately 0.9 million square feet of leased and owned property in San Francisco.

Our technologies may be subject to an injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.\nThe outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.\nFor more information regarding legal proceedings see Note 14 “Legal Proceedings and Claims” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nITEM 4.    MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4A.    INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our current executive officers as of February 28, 2025 (in alphabetical order):\nName\nAge\nPosition\nMarc Benioff\n60\nChair of the Board, CEO and co-Founder\nParker Harris\n58\nDirector, Chief Technology Officer, Slack and co-Founder\nMiguel Milano\n56\nPresident and Chief Revenue Officer\nBrian Millham\n55\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer\nSabastian Niles\n45\nPresident and Chief Legal Officer\nSundeep Reddy\n52\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer\nDavid Schmaier\n61\nPresident and Chief Product and Impact Officer\nSrinivas Tallapragada\n55\nPresident and Chief Engineering Officer and Customer Success Officer\nAmy Weaver\n57\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer\nMarc Benioff \nis Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and co-Founder of Salesforce and a pioneer of cloud computing.

If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms.\nITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to an injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.\nThe outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.\nFor more information regarding legal proceedings see Note 14 “Legal Proceedings and Claims” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nITEM 4.    MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4A.    INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our current executive officers as of February 28, 2025 (in alphabetical order):\nName\nAge\nPosition\nMarc Benioff\n60\nChair of the Board, CEO and co-Founder\nParker Harris\n58\nDirector, Chief Technology Officer, Slack and co-Founder\nMiguel Milano\n56\nPresident and Chief Revenue Officer\nBrian Millham\n55\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer\nSabastian Niles\n45\nPresident and Chief Legal Officer\nSundeep Reddy\n52\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer\nDavid Schmaier\n61\nPresident and Chief Product and Impact Officer\nSrinivas Tallapragada\n55\nPresident and Chief Engineering Officer and Customer Success Officer\nAmy Weaver\n57\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer\nMarc Benioff \nis Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and co-Founder of Salesforce and a pioneer of cloud computing.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2025 and 2024 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2025 and 2024, as well as certain fiscal 2023 items. Discussions of fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nOverview\nSalesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology, enabling companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers through the power of data, artificial intelligence (“AI”), CRM and trust. Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform. \nOur platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry.\nWe continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average.\nIn addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales a\nnd marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies. \nHighlights from Fiscal 2025\n•\nRevenue: \nFor fiscal 2025, revenue was \n$37.9 billion\n, an increase of \nnine percent \nyear-over-year. \n•\nIncome from Operations:\n For fiscal 2025, income from operations was \n$7.2 billion\n as compared to \n$5.0 billion\n from a year ago. Operating margin, which represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue, increased to approximately \n19 percent\n for fiscal 2025 compared to approximately\n 14 percent\n in the prior year.\n•\nNet Income per Share:\n For \nfiscal 2025\n, diluted net income per share was \n$6.36\n as compared to diluted net income per share of $4.20 from a year ago. \n40\nTable of Contents\n•\nCash: \nCash provided by operations for fiscal 2025 was $13.1 billion, an increase of 28 percent y\near-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2025 was \n$14.0 billion.\n \n•\nRemaining Performance Obligation:\n Total remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract yet to be recognized, as of January 31, 2025 was approximately \n$63.4 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year\n. Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2025 was approximately \n$30.2 billion\n, an increase of \nnine percent\n year-over-year. \n•\nShare Repurchase Program: \nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of our common stock for approximately $7.8 billion.\n•\nDividend Program\n: During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends. \n In the second half of fiscal 2025, we continued seeing increasing momentum for Agentforce and other AI service offerings. Outside of the demand for AI, the buying environment trends seen over the past two fiscal years have stabilized. A reemergence of slower growth in new and renewal business could impact our remaining performance obligation, revenues and our ability to meet financial guidance and long-term targets.\nIn addition, the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Total revenues in the \nfiscal year ended January 31, 2025 were minimally impacted by foreign currency\n fluctuations \ncompared to the \nfiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\n Our current remaining performance obligatio\nn growth as of January 31, 2025 compared to January 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by two percent compared to what would have been reported using constant currency rates. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations could impact our near-term results and ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations can also be compounded by the seasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\nOperating Segments\nWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. \nSources of Revenues\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately \n94 percent\n of our total revenues for fiscal 2025. \nSubscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year term software licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from term software licenses represent less than\n ten percent\n of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2025.\nThe revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in “Results of Operations,” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offerings to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage.\nOur growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully \n41\nTable of Contents\nintegrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent.\nWe continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. \nSeasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow\nUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter\n. \nUnearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. \nRemaining Performance Obligation \nOur remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.\n Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation.\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations.\nCost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success. The cost of professional services may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering staff associated with product development, as well as allocated overhead. \n42\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing\n \nSales and marketing expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of employee-related costs and commissions for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts, such as commissions, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis. As such, the timing of expense recognition for these commissions is not consistent with the timing of the associated cash payment. \nOur sales and marketing expenses include amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. \nGeneral and Administrative\n \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, as well as professional services fees and allocated overhead. \nWe allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent, occupancy charges and certain employee benefits based on headcount. As such, these types of expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring consists of charges related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits and stock-based compensation as well as exit charges associated with office space reductions. Restructuring excludes allocated overhead.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition -\n \nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations.\n We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\nCloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have generally concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.\nWe allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy and historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\nIn certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.\n43\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations.\n Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are:\n•\nfuture expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;\n•\nhistorical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n•\nassumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;\n•\ndiscount rates;\n•\nuncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed; \n•\nfair value of assumed equity awards; and\n•\nfair value of pre-existing relationships.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nIncome Taxes.\n Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.\nStrategic Investments.\n Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and these valuations require our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value for these investments, we utilize the most recent data available and apply valuation methods, including the market approach and option pricing models (“OPM”), adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the classes of securities we hold. Such information available to us from investee companies is supplemented with estimates such as volatility and expected time to liquidity.\nWe assess the privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio for impairment quarterly. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. Depending on our contractual rights as an investor, investee specific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statements of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.\nResults of Operations\n44\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in millions):\n4\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n% of Total Revenues\n2024\n% of Total Revenues\n2023\n% of Total Revenues\nRevenues:\nSubscription and support\n$\n35,679 \n94 \n%\n$\n32,537 \n93 \n%\n$\n29,021 \n93 \n%\nProfessional services and other\n2,216 \n6 \n2,320 \n7 \n2,331 \n7 \nTotal revenues\n37,895 \n100 \n34,857 \n100 \n31,352 \n100 \nCost of revenues (1)(2):\nSubscription and support \n6,198 \n16 \n6,177 \n18 \n5,821 \n19 \nProfessional services and other \n2,445 \n7 \n2,364 \n7 \n2,539 \n8 \nTotal cost of revenues\n8,643 \n23 \n8,541 \n25 \n8,360 \n27 \nGross profit\n29,252 \n77 \n26,316 \n75 \n22,992 \n73 \nOperating expenses (1)(2):\nResearch and development\n5,493 \n15 \n4,906 \n14 \n5,055 \n16 \nSales and marketing\n13,257 \n35 \n12,877 \n37 \n13,526 \n43 \nGeneral and administrative\n2,836 \n7 \n2,534 \n7 \n2,553 \n8 \nRestructuring \n461 \n1 \n988 \n3 \n828 \n3 \nTotal operating expenses\n22,047 \n58 \n21,305 \n61 \n21,962 \n70 \nIncome from operations\n7,205 \n19 \n5,011 \n14 \n1,030 \n3 \nLosses on strategic investments, net \n(121)\n0 \n(277)\n(1)\n(239)\n(1)\nOther income (expense)\n354 \n1 \n216 \n1 \n(131)\n0 \nIncome before provision for income taxes\n7,438 \n20 \n4,950 \n14 \n660 \n2 \nProvision for income taxes\n(1,241)\n(4)\n(814)\n(2)\n(452)\n(1)\nNet income\n$\n6,197 \n16 \n%\n$\n4,136 \n12 \n%\n$\n208 \n1 \n%\n(1) Amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, as follows (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n% of Total Revenues\n2024\n% of Total Revenues\n2023\n% of Total Revenues\nCost of revenues\n$\n750 \n2 \n%\n$\n978 \n3 \n%\n$\n1,035 \n3 \n%\nSales and marketing\n901 \n2 \n891 \n2 \n916 \n3 \n(2) Amounts related to stock-based compensation expense, as follows (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n% of Total Revenues\n2024\n% of Total Revenues\n2023\n% of Total Revenues\nCost of revenues\n$\n518 \n1 \n%\n$\n431 \n1 \n%\n$\n499 \n2 \n%\nResearch and development\n1,091 \n3 \n972 \n3 \n1,136 \n3 \nSales and marketing\n1,205 \n3 \n1,062 \n3 \n1,256 \n4 \nGeneral and administrative\n367 \n1 \n299 \n1 \n368 \n1 \nRestructuring \n2 \n0 \n23 \n0 \n20 \n0 \n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth selected balance sheet data and other metrics for each of the periods indicated (in millions, except remaining performance obligation, which is presented in billions):\nAs of \nJanuary 31, 2025\nJanuary 31, 2024\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n$\n14,032 \n$\n14,194 \nUnearned revenue\n20,743 \n19,003 \nRemaining performance obligation\n63.4 \n56.9 \nPrincipal due on our outstanding debt obligations (1)\n8,500 \n9,500 \n(1) Amounts do not include operating or financing lease obligations.\nRemaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. \nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2025 and 2024\nRevenues\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\nVariance\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nDollars\nPercent\nSubscription and support\n$\n35,679 \n$\n32,537 \n$\n3,142 \n10 \n%\nProfessional services and other\n2,216 \n2,320 \n(104)\n(4)\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n37,895 \n$\n34,857 \n$\n3,038 \n9 \n%\nThe increase in subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2025 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period. Revenues from term software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represented approximately six percent and seven percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent and 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe decrease in professional services and other revenues for fiscal 2025 was due primarily to less demand for larger, multi-year transformation engagements and, in some cases, delayed projects.

Therefore, we expect Integration and Analytics to experience greater volatility in revenues period to period compared to our other service offerings and recent revenue trends may not be indicative of future performance. Additionally, as we transition customers within the Integration and Analytics offering from term software licenses to subscription based services, revenue associated with such customers will generally be recognized ratably over the contract term, which we expect may potentially result in less revenue in the period the customer transitions but incremental revenues over the remaining term.\n46\nTable of Contents\nRevenues\n \nby Geography\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n(in millions)\n2025\nAs a % of Total Revenues\n2024\nAs a % of Total Revenues\nGrowth Rate\nAmericas\n$\n25,143 \n66 \n%\n$\n23,289 \n67 \n%\n8 \n%\nEurope\n8,891 \n24 \n8,128 \n23 \n9 \nAsia Pacific\n3,861 \n10 \n3,440 \n10 \n12 \nTotal\n$\n37,895 \n100 \n%\n$\n34,857 \n100 \n%\n9 \n%\nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2025 and 2024 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2025 and 2024, as well as certain fiscal 2023 items. Discussions of fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nOverview\nSalesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology, enabling companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers through the power of data, artificial intelligence (“AI”), CRM and trust. Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform. \nOur platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry.\nWe continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average.\nIn addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales a\nnd marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies. \nHighlights from Fiscal 2025\n•\nRevenue: \nFor fiscal 2025, revenue was \n$37.9 billion\n, an increase of \nnine percent \nyear-over-year. \n•\nIncome from Operations:\n For fiscal 2025, income from operations was \n$7.2 billion\n as compared to \n$5.0 billion\n from a year ago. Operating margin, which represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue, increased to approximately \n19 percent\n for fiscal 2025 compared to approximately\n 14 percent\n in the prior year.\n•\nNet Income per Share:\n For \nfiscal 2025\n, diluted net income per share was \n$6.36\n as compared to diluted net income per share of $4.20 from a year ago. \n40\nTable of Contents\n•\nCash: \nCash provided by operations for fiscal 2025 was $13.1 billion, an increase of 28 percent y\near-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2025 was \n$14.0 billion.\n \n•\nRemaining Performance Obligation:\n Total remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract yet to be recognized, as of January 31, 2025 was approximately \n$63.4 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year\n. Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2025 was approximately \n$30.2 billion\n, an increase of \nnine percent\n year-over-year. \n•\nShare Repurchase Program: \nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of our common stock for approximately $7.8 billion.\n•\nDividend Program\n: During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends. \n In the second half of fiscal 2025, we continued seeing increasing momentum for Agentforce and other AI service offerings. Outside of the demand for AI, the buying environment trends seen over the past two fiscal years have stabilized. A reemergence of slower growth in new and renewal business could impact our remaining performance obligation, revenues and our ability to meet financial guidance and long-term targets.\nIn addition, the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Total revenues in the \nfiscal year ended January 31, 2025 were minimally impacted by foreign currency\n fluctuations \ncompared to the \nfiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\n Our current remaining performance obligatio\nn growth as of January 31, 2025 compared to January 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by two percent compared to what would have been reported using constant currency rates. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations could impact our near-term results and ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations can also be compounded by the seasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\nOperating Segments\nWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. \nSources of Revenues\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately \n94 percent\n of our total revenues for fiscal 2025. \nSubscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year term software licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from term software licenses represent less than\n ten percent\n of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2025.\nThe revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in “Results of Operations,” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offerings to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage.\nOur growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully \n41\nTable of Contents\nintegrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent.\nWe continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. \nSeasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow\nUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter\n. \nUnearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. \nRemaining Performance Obligation \nOur remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.\n Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation.\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations.\nCost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success. The cost of professional services may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering staff associated with product development, as well as allocated overhead. \n42\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing\n \nSales and marketing expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of employee-related costs and commissions for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts, such as commissions, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis. As such, the timing of expense recognition for these commissions is not consistent with the timing of the associated cash payment. \nOur sales and marketing expenses include amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. \nGeneral and Administrative\n \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, as well as professional services fees and allocated overhead. \nWe allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent, occupancy charges and certain employee benefits based on headcount. As such, these types of expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring consists of charges related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits and stock-based compensation as well as exit charges associated with office space reductions. Restructuring excludes allocated overhead.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition -\n \nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations.\n We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\nCloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have generally concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.\nWe allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy and historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\nIn certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.\n43\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations.\n Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are:\n•\nfuture expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;\n•\nhistorical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n•\nassumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;\n•\ndiscount rates;\n•\nuncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed; \n•\nfair value of assumed equity awards; and\n•\nfair value of pre-existing relationships.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nIncome Taxes.\n Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.\nStrategic Investments.\n Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and these valuations require our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value for these investments, we utilize the most recent data available and apply valuation methods, including the market approach and option pricing models (“OPM”), adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the classes of securities we hold. Such information available to us from investee companies is supplemented with estimates such as volatility and expected time to liquidity.\nWe assess the privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio for impairment quarterly. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. Depending on our contractual rights as an investor, investee specific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statements of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.\nResults of Operations\n44\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in millions):\n4\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n% of Total Revenues\n2024\n% of Total Revenues\n2023\n% of Total Revenues\nRevenues:\nSubscription and support\n$\n35,679 \n94 \n%\n$\n32,537 \n93 \n%\n$\n29,021 \n93 \n%\nProfessional services and other\n2,216 \n6 \n2,320 \n7 \n2,331 \n7 \nTotal revenues\n37,895 \n100 \n34,857 \n100 \n31,352 \n100 \nCost of revenues (1)(2):\nSubscription and support \n6,198 \n16 \n6,177 \n18 \n5,821 \n19 \nProfessional services and other \n2,445 \n7 \n2,364 \n7 \n2,539 \n8 \nTotal cost of revenues\n8,643 \n23 \n8,541 \n25 \n8,360 \n27 \nGross profit\n29,252 \n77 \n26,316 \n75 \n22,992 \n73 \nOperating expenses (1)(2):\nResearch and development\n5,493 \n15 \n4,906 \n14 \n5,055 \n16 \nSales and marketing\n13,257 \n35 \n12,877 \n37 \n13,526 \n43 \nGeneral and administrative\n2,836 \n7 \n2,534 \n7 \n2,553 \n8 \nRestructuring \n461 \n1 \n988 \n3 \n828 \n3 \nTotal operating expenses\n22,047 \n58 \n21,305 \n61 \n21,962 \n70 \nIncome from operations\n7,205 \n19 \n5,011 \n14 \n1,030 \n3 \nLosses on strategic investments, net \n(121)\n0 \n(277)\n(1)\n(239)\n(1)\nOther income (expense)\n354 \n1 \n216 \n1 \n(131)\n0 \nIncome before provision for income taxes\n7,438 \n20 \n4,950 \n14 \n660 \n2 \nProvision for income taxes\n(1,241)\n(4)\n(814)\n(2)\n(452)\n(1)\nNet income\n$\n6,197 \n16 \n%\n$\n4,136 \n12 \n%\n$\n208 \n1 \n%\n(1) Amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, as follows (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n% of Total Revenues\n2024\n% of Total Revenues\n2023\n% of Total Revenues\nCost of revenues\n$\n750 \n2 \n%\n$\n978 \n3 \n%\n$\n1,035 \n3 \n%\nSales and marketing\n901 \n2 \n891 \n2 \n916 \n3 \n(2) Amounts related to stock-based compensation expense, as follows (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n% of Total Revenues\n2024\n% of Total Revenues\n2023\n% of Total Revenues\nCost of revenues\n$\n518 \n1 \n%\n$\n431 \n1 \n%\n$\n499 \n2 \n%\nResearch and development\n1,091 \n3 \n972 \n3 \n1,136 \n3 \nSales and marketing\n1,205 \n3 \n1,062 \n3 \n1,256 \n4 \nGeneral and administrative\n367 \n1 \n299 \n1 \n368 \n1 \nRestructuring \n2 \n0 \n23 \n0 \n20 \n0 \n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth selected balance sheet data and other metrics for each of the periods indicated (in millions, except remaining performance obligation, which is presented in billions):\nAs of \nJanuary 31, 2025\nJanuary 31, 2024\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n$\n14,032 \n$\n14,194 \nUnearned revenue\n20,743 \n19,003 \nRemaining performance obligation\n63.4 \n56.9 \nPrincipal due on our outstanding debt obligations (1)\n8,500 \n9,500 \n(1) Amounts do not include operating or financing lease obligations.\nRemaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. \nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2025 and 2024\nRevenues\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\nVariance\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nDollars\nPercent\nSubscription and support\n$\n35,679 \n$\n32,537 \n$\n3,142 \n10 \n%\nProfessional services and other\n2,216 \n2,320 \n(104)\n(4)\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n37,895 \n$\n34,857 \n$\n3,038 \n9 \n%\nThe increase in subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2025 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period. Revenues from term software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represented approximately six percent and seven percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent and 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe decrease in professional services and other revenues for fiscal 2025 was due primarily to less demand for larger, multi-year transformation engagements and, in some cases, delayed projects. These trends may continue in the near term.\nSubscription and Support Revenues by Service Offering\nSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): \n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\nAs a % of Total Subscription and Support Revenues\n2024\nAs a % of Total Subscription and Support Revenues\nGrowth Rate\nSales \n$\n8,322 \n23 \n%\n$\n7,580 \n23 \n%\n10 \n%\nService\n9,054 \n25 \n8,245 \n25 \n10 \nPlatform and Other\n7,247 \n21 \n6,611 \n21 \n10 \nMarketing and Commerce \n5,281 \n15 \n4,912 \n15 \n8 \nIntegration and Analytics\n5,775 \n16 \n5,189 \n16 \n11 \nTotal\n$\n35,679 \n100 \n%\n$\n32,537 \n100 \n%\n10 \n%\nOur industry vertical service offerings revenue is included in one of the above service offerings depending on the primary service purchased.\nIntegration and Analytics subscription and support revenues include revenues from term software licenses, which are recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Therefore, we expect Integration and Analytics to experience greater volatility in revenues period to period compared to our other service offerings and recent revenue trends may not be indicative of future performance. Additionally, as we transition customers within the Integration and Analytics offering from term software licenses to subscription based services, revenue associated with such customers will generally be recognized ratably over the contract term, which we expect may potentially result in less revenue in the period the customer transitions but incremental revenues over the remaining term.\n46\nTable of Contents\nRevenues\n \nby Geography\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n(in millions)\n2025\nAs a % of Total Revenues\n2024\nAs a % of Total Revenues\nGrowth Rate\nAmericas\n$\n25,143 \n66 \n%\n$\n23,289 \n67 \n%\n8 \n%\nEurope\n8,891 \n24 \n8,128 \n23 \n9 \nAsia Pacific\n3,861 \n10 \n3,440 \n10 \n12 \nTotal\n$\n37,895 \n100 \n%\n$\n34,857 \n100 \n%\n9 \n%\nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer.

Our tax provision increased from a year ago primarily due to higher pretax income. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate due to changes in our domestic and foreign earnings, or material discrete tax items, or a combination of these factors resulting from transactions or events, including acquisitions, changes to our operating structure and other macroeconomic factors.\nSeveral countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 15% global minimum tax regime effective January 1, 2024. There was no material impact to our income tax provision for fiscal 2025. We continue to evaluate the impacts of legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate and cash tax payment could increase in future years.\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2024 and 2023\nFor a discussion of the year ended January 31, 2024 compared to the year ended January 31, 2023, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt January 31, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $14.0 billion and accounts receivable of $11.9 billion. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, asset-backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage-backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. Our Revolving Loan Credit Agreement (as defined below), which provides the ability to borrow up to $5.0 billion in unsecured financing (the “Credit Facility”) as of January 31, 2025, also serves as a source of liquidity.\n48\nTable of Contents\nNet cash provided by operating activities could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted noncancellable subscription agreements, which are not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt maintenance needs over the next 12 months and thereafter. \nIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.\nCash\n \nFlows\nFor fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 our cash flows were as follows (in millions):\n4\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n13,092 \n$\n10,234 \n$\n7,111 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(3,163)\n(1,327)\n(1,989)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(9,429)\n(7,477)\n(3,562)\nOperating Activities\nThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 was primarily comprised of net income of $6.2 billion, adjusted for non-cash items, including $3.5 billion of depreciation and amortization and $3.2 billion of stock-based compensation expense. Net cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by factors such as growth in new business, timing of cash receipts from customers, vendor payment terms and timing of payments to vendors. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 was further benefited by \nthe changes in \nunearned revenue of $1.6 billion and accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1.1 billion,\n \npartially offset by the changes in costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, net of $2.1 billion, prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets of $1.5 billion and \naccounts receivable, net of $490 million. \nAs our business continues to grow, and assuming our expenses remain in line with or less than our revenue growth, we expect to continue to see growth in net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2024 was primarily comprised of net income of $4.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items, including $4.0 billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 billion of stock-based compensation expense. Net cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by factors such as growth in new business, timing of cash receipts from customers, vendor payment terms and timing of payments to vendors.

We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2025. \n49\nTable of Contents\nIn October 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement with the lenders and issuing lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement replaced the Credit Agreement, dated December 23, 2020 (as amended, the “Prior Credit Agreement”), among us, the lenders and the issuing lenders party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, which provided for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on December 23, 2025. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement. \nThe Revolving Loan Credit Agreement provides for a $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) and matures in October 2029. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025.\nWe do not have any special purpose entities and we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn August 2022, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. In February 2023, the Board authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2024, the Board authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program for an aggregate total authorization of $30.0 billion. \nWe repurchased the following under the Share Repurchase Program (in millions, except average price per share):\n2025\n2024\n2023\nShares\nAverage price per share\nAmount\nShares\nAverage price per share\nAmount\nShares\nAverage price per share\nAmount\nFiscal year ended January 31\n30 \n$\n260.12 \n$\n7,757 \n36 \n$\n210.30 \n$\n7,674 \n28 \n$\n144.94 \n$\n4,000 \nAll repurchases were made in open market transactions.

As of January 31, 2025, the future noncancellable minimum payments under these commitments were approximately $4.0 billion, with payments of $1.0 billion due in the next 12 months and $3.0 billion due thereafter. In addition to our leasing arrangements, we have other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, including those with infrastructure service providers. As of January 31, 2025 our total commitments under these agreements were approximately $17.3 billion, of which payments of $2.8 billion are due in the next 12 months and $14.5 billion are due thereafter. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. \nDuring \nfiscal 2025\n and in future years, we have made, and expect to continue to make, additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations to increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. While we continue to make investments in our infrastructure and with infrastructure service providers to provide capacity for the growth of our business, our strategy may continue to change related to these investments and we may slow the pace of our investments.\n50\nTable of Contents\nOther Future Obligations\nAs of January 31, 2025, we expect approximately $300 million to $325 million in future cash payments related to our restructuring initiatives, primarily related to workforce costs such as severance payments. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. \nStakeholder Impact\nWe believe that business is the greatest platform for change.

This exposure has increased due to recent financial market movements and changes to our expectations of near-term possible movements caused by the impact of the macroeconomic environment as discussed in more detail below.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency and growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party infrastructure providers and additional headcount in foreign countries. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Brazilian Real against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. \nForeign Currency Transaction Risk\nOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. \nWe pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments under the relevant accounting and financial reporting guidelines. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. \nForeign Currency Translation Risk\nFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we repor\nt for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Total revenue during \nfiscal 2025\n was \nminimally impacted\n by fluctuations in foreign currencies compared to \nfiscal 2024\n. \nIn addition, fluctuations in foreign currencies negatively impacted our current remaining performance obligation growth rate as of January 31, 2025 by approximately two percent compared to what we would have reported as of January 31, 2024 using constant currency rates.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $14.0 billion. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in interest rates. Gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations are limited to those related to either the sale of securities prior to maturity or expected credit losses. \nOur fixed-income portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2025 could result in a $61 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, net, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAt January 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $14.2 billion.

We are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts. As of January 31, 2025, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Facility.\nThe bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.\nStrategic Investments\nAs of January 31, 2025, our strategic investment portfolio consisted of investments in ove\nr 400 companies wit\nh a combined carrying value of $4.9 billion, includ\ning four privately he\nld investments with carrying values that were individually greater th\nan five percent of t\nhe total strategic investments portfolio and repres\nented 24 percent of th\ne portfolio in aggregate. \nThe following table sets forth additional information regarding active equity investments within our strategic investment portfolio as of January 31, 2025 and excludes exited investments (in millions):\nInvestment Type \nCapital Invested \nUnrealized Gains (Cumulative) \nUnrealized Losses (Cumulative)\nCarrying Value as of January 31, 2025\nPublicly held equity securities \n$\n34 \n$\n42 \n$\n(7)\n$\n69 \nPrivately held equity securities \n4,342 \n1,148 \n(748)\n4,742 \nTotal equity securities\n$\n4,376 \n$\n1,190 \n$\n(755)\n$\n4,811 \nFluctuations in the value of our privately held equity securities are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar security of the same issuer, or in the event of impairment. These investments are in various classes of equity with varying rights and preferences. The particular securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to other securities within the capital structure of a company, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to changes in the total fair value of that company. For example, our five largest privately held equity securities represent $1.3 billion in total strategic investments as of January 31, 2025. If the enterprise value of the companies in which we hold those securities decreased by ten percent, the carrying value of our investment portfolio would decline by approximatel\ny\n $84 million.

This exposure has increased due to recent financial market movements and changes to our expectations of near-term possible movements caused by the impact of the macroeconomic environment as discussed in more detail below.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency and growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party infrastructure providers and additional headcount in foreign countries. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Brazilian Real against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. \nForeign Currency Transaction Risk\nOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. \nWe pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments under the relevant accounting and financial reporting guidelines. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. \nForeign Currency Translation Risk\nFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we repor\nt for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Total revenue during \nfiscal 2025\n was \nminimally impacted\n by fluctuations in foreign currencies compared to \nfiscal 2024\n. \nIn addition, fluctuations in foreign currencies negatively impacted our current remaining performance obligation growth rate as of January 31, 2025 by approximately two percent compared to what we would have reported as of January 31, 2024 using constant currency rates.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $14.0 billion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We evaluated the information available to determine the appropriateness of the Company’s conclusions of whether the investments are impaired.\n\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 5, 2025\n57\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Salesforce, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Salesforce, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP", "word_count": 583, "token_count": 705, "start_char": 679744, "end_char": 683770, "local_heads": [], "metadata_snapshot": {"doctype": "10-K", "date": "2015-08-31", "topic": "Agentforce|Data Cloud|Earnings|Partnership|Product", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm", "title": "crm-20250131", "company": "Salesforce", "persona_tags": ["cio", "vp_customer_experience", "vp_sales_ops"]}}

(the “Company”) is a global leader in customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together. With the deeply unified Salesforce Platform, the Company delivers a single source of truth, connecting customer data with integrated artificial intelligence (“AI”) across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and conduct commerce from anywhere. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company introduced Agentforce, a new layer of the trusted Salesforce Platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. Since its founding in 1999, the Company has pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and AI, enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the digital-first world.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:\n•\nthe standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;\n•\nthe valuation of privately-held strategic investments;\n•\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;\n•\nthe recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;\n•\nthe useful lives of intangible assets; and\n•\nthe fair value of certain stock awards issued.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses to be recognized.\n \nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nThe Company operates as \none\n operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions which have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company’s business operates in \none\n operating segment because most of the Company's service offerings operate on the Salesforce Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner, and the Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated net income basis. Additionally, the measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.\nThe Company’s significant segment expenses, which are the expenses included in operating income as well as losses on strategic investments, and other segment items, which includes other income (expense) and benefit from (provision for) income taxes, are included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, further components of the Company’s measure of profit or loss, which is net income, are included throughout the Company’s financial statements.\n65\nTable of Contents\nConcentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments\nThe Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company’s marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investment-grade securities and the Company’s policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n \nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were \n17\n percent and \n16\n percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were \n81\n percent and \n82\n percent of total assets, respectively.\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology st\nartups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately\n \n24\n percent o\nf the portfolio in the aggregate. As of \nJanuary 31, 2024\n, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately \n16\n percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. \nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company’s enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n•\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n•\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n•\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n•\nrecognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\nSubscription and Support Revenues\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement. \nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company’s subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized \n66\nTable of Contents\nat the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from software support and updates is recognized as the support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term.\nThe Company typically invoices its customers annually and its payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenues\nThe Company’s professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed price or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. Other revenues consist primarily of training revenues recognized as such services are performed.\nSignificant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple performance obligations such as Cloud Services, software licenses, support and updates and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are concluded to be distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\nCloud Services, software licenses and support and updates services are generally concluded to be distinct because such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company’s discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company’s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, the Company's go-to-market strategy, historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where the Company does not sell or price a product or service separately, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As the Company’s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\nIn certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when indicated by the distribution of its observable prices.\nAlternatively, the Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when the pricing practices or distribution of the observable prices are highly variable. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.\nCosts Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts related to noncancellable Cloud Services subscription, ongoing Cloud Services support and license support and updates. For contracts with term software licenses where revenue is recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer, costs allocable to those licenses are expensed as they are incurred. Capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Company’s direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Company’s employees and (4) to a lesser extent, success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence. \nCosts capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over \nfour years\n, which is longer than the typical initial contract period, but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors which included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid to partners over \ntwo years\n. \n67\nTable of Contents\nThe capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all noncancellable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. \nAmortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n There were \nno\n impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nThe Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. \nPrivately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations.\nPublicly held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, publicly held equity securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. In addition, the Company measures certain of its strategic investments, including its privately held debt and equity securities, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security or an impairment event.\n The additional disclosures regarding the Company’s fair value measurements are included in Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement.”\n68\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk associated with intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to minimize the Company’s exposure to balances primarily denominated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen. The Company’s derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the financial institutions with which it contracts for such derivatives, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty, thereby reducing risk of credit-related losses from a financial institutions' nonperformance. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. The notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024 was $\n10.7\n billion and $\n8.6\n billion, respectively. \nOutstanding foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts, as well as realized gains or losses from their net settlement, are recognized as other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations consistent with the offsetting gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement or settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows:\nBuildings and building improvements\n10\n to \n40\n years\nComputers, equipment and software\n3\n to \n5\n years\nFurniture and fixtures\n5\n years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of the estimated lease term or \n10\n years\nThe Company estimates the useful lives of property and equipment upon initial recognition and periodically evaluates the useful lives and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the useful lives.\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.\nLeases \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and classifies its leases at commencement. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Assets (also referred to as ROU assets) and liabilities recognized from finance leases are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less for any asset classes.\nLease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement, net of any future tenant incentives. The Company has lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to combine for all asset classes. As such, minimum lease payments include fixed payments for non-lease components within a lease agreement but exclude variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate, such as common area maintenance, operating expenses, utilities, or other costs that are subject to fluctuation from period to period. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. The Company reassesses the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within the control of the Company. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is an estimate of the interest rate the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in the economic environment where the leased asset is located.\nThe lease ROU asset is recognized based on the lease liability, adjusted for any rent payments or initial direct costs incurred or tenant incentives received prior to commencement. \n69\nTable of Contents\nLease expense for operating leases, which includes amortization expense of ROU assets, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization expense of finance lease ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense for finance lease liabilities is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate. Expense for variable lease payments is recognized as incurred.\nOn the lease commencement date, the Company also establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are included in property and equipment, net and are amortized over the lease term.\nThe Company has entered into subleases or has made decisions and taken actions to exit and sublease certain unoccupied leased office space. Similar to other long-lived assets discussed below, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a leased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease.\nIntangible Assets Acquired through Business Combinations\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.\nImpairment Assessment\nThe Company evaluates intangible assets and other long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to, significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. \nThe Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.\n \nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the event the Company acquires an entity with which the Company has a preexisting relationship, the Company will generally recognize a gain or loss to settle that relationship as of the acquisition date within operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. In the event that the Company acquires an entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and recorded within losses on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRestructuring \nThe Company generally recognizes employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable or when notification occurs, depending on the region an employee works. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred.\n \nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense is measured based on grant date at fair value using the grant date closing stock price for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards and using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and stock \n70\nTable of Contents\noptions on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of \nfour years\n. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates.\nThe Company grants performance share awards to executive officers and other members of senior management, which may include a market condition, a performance condition, or both. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market condition are measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the expense related to these awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a performance condition are measured based on the grant date closing stock price and the expense related to these awards is recognized based on the requisite service period elapsed, as well as the probability of achievement and estimated attainment of the performance condition as of the end of our reporting period.\nStock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP” or “2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan”) is measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is \n12\n months. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a \n15\n percent discount from the lower of the Company’s stock price on (i) the first day of the offering period or on (ii) the last day of the purchase period. The ESPP also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a \nsix-month\n purchase period (December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not to increase that election until the next one-year offering period. The ESPP includes a reset provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date.\nThe Company, at times, grants unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment. Therefore, the Company accounts for them as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards, based on the closing stock price on grant date, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally \nfour years\n.\n \nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising is expensed as incurred.\n Advertising expense was $\n1.0\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company’s tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company’s major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. \n71\nTable of Contents\ndollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nWarranties and Indemnification\nThe Company’s arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2025\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires additional operating segment disclosures in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 on a retrospective basis.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective or prospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires disaggregation of certain costs in a separate note to the financial statements, such as the amounts of employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, included in each relevant expense caption in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027 on a retrospective or prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2024-03 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n2. \nRevenues\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSubscription and Support Revenue by the Company's Service Offerings\nSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nSales \n$\n8,322\n \n$\n7,580\n \n$\n6,831\n \nService \n9,054\n \n8,245\n \n7,369\n \nPlatform and Other \n7,247\n \n6,611\n \n5,967\n \nMarketing and Commerce\n5,281\n \n4,912\n \n4,516\n \nIntegration and Analytics (1) \n5,775\n \n5,189\n \n4,338\n \n$\n35,679\n \n$\n32,537\n \n$\n29,021\n \n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company renamed the service offering previously referred to as Data to Integration and Analytics, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau. \n72\nTable of Contents\nTotal Revenue by Geographic Locations\nRevenues by geographical region consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nAmericas\n$\n25,143\n \n$\n23,289\n \n$\n21,250\n \nEurope\n8,891\n \n8,128\n \n7,163\n \nAsia Pacific\n3,861\n \n3,440\n \n2,939\n \n$\n37,895\n \n$\n34,857\n \n$\n31,352\n \nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Company's contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately \n93\n percent during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.\nContract Balances\nContract Assets\nThe Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. Contract assets were $\n724\n million as of January 31, 2025 as compared to $\n758\n million as of January 31, 2024, and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. \nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred or services have been provided. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable subscription agreements. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.\nThe change in unearned revenue was as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n2025\n2024\nUnearned revenue, beginning of period\n$\n19,003\n \n$\n17,376\n \nBillings and other (1)\n39,513\n \n36,370\n \nContribution from contract asset\n(\n34\n)\n110\n \nRevenue recognized over time\n(\n35,628\n)\n(\n32,727\n)\nRevenue recognized at a point in time\n(\n2,267\n)\n(\n2,130\n)\nUnearned revenue from business combinations\n156\n \n4\n \nUnearned revenue, end of period\n$\n20,743\n \n$\n19,003\n \n(1) Other includes, for example, the impact of foreign currency translation.\nRevenue recognized over time primarily includes Cloud Services subscription and support revenue, which is generally recognized ratably over time, and professional services and other revenue, which is generally recognized ratably or as delivered.\nRevenue recognized at a point in time substantially consists of term software licenses.\nApproximately \n50\n percent of total revenue recognized in fiscal 2025 was from the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2024.\nRemaining Performance Obligation \nRemaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is based on SSP. Remaining performance obligation is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of term license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is subject to future economic risks, including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe Company excludes amounts related to performance obligations from professional services contracts that are billed and recognized on a time and materials basis. \nThe majority of the Company's noncurrent remaining performance obligation is expected to be recognized in the next \n13\n to \n36\n months.\nRemaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions):\n \nCurrent\nNoncurrent\nTotal\nAs of January 31, 2025\n$\n30.2\n \n$\n33.2\n \n$\n63.4\n \nAs of January 31, 2024\n$\n27.6\n \n$\n29.3\n \n$\n56.9\n \n3. \nInvestments\nMarketable Securities\nAt January 31, 2025, marketable securities consisted of the following (in millions):\nAmortized", "word_count": 7156, "token_count": 9190, "start_char": 706868, "end_char": 755062, "local_heads": [], "metadata_snapshot": {"doctype": "10-K", "date": "2015-08-31", "topic": "Agentforce|Data Cloud|Earnings|Partnership|Product", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm", "title": "crm-20250131", "company": "Salesforce", "persona_tags": ["cio", "vp_customer_experience", "vp_sales_ops"]}}

(the “Company”) is a global leader in customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together. With the deeply unified Salesforce Platform, the Company delivers a single source of truth, connecting customer data with integrated artificial intelligence (“AI”) across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and conduct commerce from anywhere. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company introduced Agentforce, a new layer of the trusted Salesforce Platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. Since its founding in 1999, the Company has pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and AI, enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the digital-first world.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:\n•\nthe standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;\n•\nthe valuation of privately-held strategic investments;\n•\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;\n•\nthe recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;\n•\nthe useful lives of intangible assets; and\n•\nthe fair value of certain stock awards issued.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses to be recognized.\n \nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nThe Company operates as \none\n operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions which have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company’s business operates in \none\n operating segment because most of the Company's service offerings operate on the Salesforce Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner, and the Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated net income basis. Additionally, the measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.\nThe Company’s significant segment expenses, which are the expenses included in operating income as well as losses on strategic investments, and other segment items, which includes other income (expense) and benefit from (provision for) income taxes, are included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, further components of the Company’s measure of profit or loss, which is net income, are included throughout the Company’s financial statements.\n65\nTable of Contents\nConcentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments\nThe Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company’s marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investment-grade securities and the Company’s policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n \nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were \n17\n percent and \n16\n percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were \n81\n percent and \n82\n percent of total assets, respectively.\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology st\nartups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately\n \n24\n percent o\nf the portfolio in the aggregate. As of \nJanuary 31, 2024\n, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately \n16\n percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. \nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company’s enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n•\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n•\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n•\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n•\nrecognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\nSubscription and Support Revenues\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement. \nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company’s subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized \n66\nTable of Contents\nat the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from software support and updates is recognized as the support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term.\nThe Company typically invoices its customers annually and its payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenues\nThe Company’s professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed price or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. Other revenues consist primarily of training revenues recognized as such services are performed.\nSignificant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple performance obligations such as Cloud Services, software licenses, support and updates and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are concluded to be distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\nCloud Services, software licenses and support and updates services are generally concluded to be distinct because such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company’s discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company’s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, the Company's go-to-market strategy, historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where the Company does not sell or price a product or service separately, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As the Company’s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\nIn certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when indicated by the distribution of its observable prices.\nAlternatively, the Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when the pricing practices or distribution of the observable prices are highly variable. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.\nCosts Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts related to noncancellable Cloud Services subscription, ongoing Cloud Services support and license support and updates. For contracts with term software licenses where revenue is recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer, costs allocable to those licenses are expensed as they are incurred. Capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Company’s direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Company’s employees and (4) to a lesser extent, success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence. \nCosts capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over \nfour years\n, which is longer than the typical initial contract period, but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors which included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid to partners over \ntwo years\n. \n67\nTable of Contents\nThe capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all noncancellable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. \nAmortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n There were \nno\n impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nThe Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. \nPrivately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations.\nPublicly held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, publicly held equity securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. In addition, the Company measures certain of its strategic investments, including its privately held debt and equity securities, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security or an impairment event.\n The additional disclosures regarding the Company’s fair value measurements are included in Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement.”\n68\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk associated with intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to minimize the Company’s exposure to balances primarily denominated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen. The Company’s derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the financial institutions with which it contracts for such derivatives, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty, thereby reducing risk of credit-related losses from a financial institutions' nonperformance. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. The notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024 was $\n10.7\n billion and $\n8.6\n billion, respectively. \nOutstanding foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts, as well as realized gains or losses from their net settlement, are recognized as other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations consistent with the offsetting gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement or settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows:\nBuildings and building improvements\n10\n to \n40\n years\nComputers, equipment and software\n3\n to \n5\n years\nFurniture and fixtures\n5\n years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of the estimated lease term or \n10\n years\nThe Company estimates the useful lives of property and equipment upon initial recognition and periodically evaluates the useful lives and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the useful lives.\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.\nLeases \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and classifies its leases at commencement. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Assets (also referred to as ROU assets) and liabilities recognized from finance leases are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less for any asset classes.\nLease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement, net of any future tenant incentives. The Company has lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to combine for all asset classes. As such, minimum lease payments include fixed payments for non-lease components within a lease agreement but exclude variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate, such as common area maintenance, operating expenses, utilities, or other costs that are subject to fluctuation from period to period. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. The Company reassesses the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within the control of the Company. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is an estimate of the interest rate the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in the economic environment where the leased asset is located.\nThe lease ROU asset is recognized based on the lease liability, adjusted for any rent payments or initial direct costs incurred or tenant incentives received prior to commencement. \n69\nTable of Contents\nLease expense for operating leases, which includes amortization expense of ROU assets, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization expense of finance lease ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense for finance lease liabilities is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate. Expense for variable lease payments is recognized as incurred.\nOn the lease commencement date, the Company also establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are included in property and equipment, net and are amortized over the lease term.\nThe Company has entered into subleases or has made decisions and taken actions to exit and sublease certain unoccupied leased office space. Similar to other long-lived assets discussed below, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a leased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease.\nIntangible Assets Acquired through Business Combinations\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.\nImpairment Assessment\nThe Company evaluates intangible assets and other long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to, significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. \nThe Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.\n \nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the event the Company acquires an entity with which the Company has a preexisting relationship, the Company will generally recognize a gain or loss to settle that relationship as of the acquisition date within operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. In the event that the Company acquires an entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and recorded within losses on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRestructuring \nThe Company generally recognizes employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable or when notification occurs, depending on the region an employee works. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred.\n \nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense is measured based on grant date at fair value using the grant date closing stock price for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards and using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and stock \n70\nTable of Contents\noptions on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of \nfour years\n. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates.\nThe Company grants performance share awards to executive officers and other members of senior management, which may include a market condition, a performance condition, or both. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market condition are measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the expense related to these awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a performance condition are measured based on the grant date closing stock price and the expense related to these awards is recognized based on the requisite service period elapsed, as well as the probability of achievement and estimated attainment of the performance condition as of the end of our reporting period.\nStock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP” or “2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan”) is measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is \n12\n months. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a \n15\n percent discount from the lower of the Company’s stock price on (i) the first day of the offering period or on (ii) the last day of the purchase period. The ESPP also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a \nsix-month\n purchase period (December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not to increase that election until the next one-year offering period. The ESPP includes a reset provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date.\nThe Company, at times, grants unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment. Therefore, the Company accounts for them as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards, based on the closing stock price on grant date, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally \nfour years\n.\n \nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising is expensed as incurred.\n Advertising expense was $\n1.0\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company’s tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company’s major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. \n71\nTable of Contents\ndollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nWarranties and Indemnification\nThe Company’s arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2025\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires additional operating segment disclosures in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 on a retrospective basis.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective or prospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires disaggregation of certain costs in a separate note to the financial statements, such as the amounts of employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, included in each relevant expense caption in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027 on a retrospective or prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2024-03 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n2. \nRevenues\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSubscription and Support Revenue by the Company's Service Offerings\nSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nSales \n$\n8,322\n \n$\n7,580\n \n$\n6,831\n \nService \n9,054\n \n8,245\n \n7,369\n \nPlatform and Other \n7,247\n \n6,611\n \n5,967\n \nMarketing and Commerce\n5,281\n \n4,912\n \n4,516\n \nIntegration and Analytics (1) \n5,775\n \n5,189\n \n4,338\n \n$\n35,679\n \n$\n32,537\n \n$\n29,021\n \n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company renamed the service offering previously referred to as Data to Integration and Analytics, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau. \n72\nTable of Contents\nTotal Revenue by Geographic Locations\nRevenues by geographical region consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nAmericas\n$\n25,143\n \n$\n23,289\n \n$\n21,250\n \nEurope\n8,891\n \n8,128\n \n7,163\n \nAsia Pacific\n3,861\n \n3,440\n \n2,939\n \n$\n37,895\n \n$\n34,857\n \n$\n31,352\n \nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Company's contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately \n93\n percent during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.\nContract Balances\nContract Assets\nThe Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. Contract assets were $\n724\n million as of January 31, 2025 as compared to $\n758\n million as of January 31, 2024, and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. \nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred or services have been provided. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable subscription agreements. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.\nThe change in unearned revenue was as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n2025\n2024\nUnearned revenue, beginning of period\n$\n19,003\n \n$\n17,376\n \nBillings and other (1)\n39,513\n \n36,370\n \nContribution from contract asset\n(\n34\n)\n110\n \nRevenue recognized over time\n(\n35,628\n)\n(\n32,727\n)\nRevenue recognized at a point in time\n(\n2,267\n)\n(\n2,130\n)\nUnearned revenue from business combinations\n156\n \n4\n \nUnearned revenue, end of period\n$\n20,743\n \n$\n19,003\n \n(1) Other includes, for example, the impact of foreign currency translation.\nRevenue recognized over time primarily includes Cloud Services subscription and support revenue, which is generally recognized ratably over time, and professional services and other revenue, which is generally recognized ratably or as delivered.\nRevenue recognized at a point in time substantially consists of term software licenses.\nApproximately \n50\n percent of total revenue recognized in fiscal 2025 was from the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2024.\nRemaining Performance Obligation \nRemaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is based on SSP. Remaining performance obligation is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of term license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is subject to future economic risks, including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe Company excludes amounts related to performance obligations from professional services contracts that are billed and recognized on a time and materials basis. \nThe majority of the Company's noncurrent remaining performance obligation is expected to be recognized in the next \n13\n to \n36\n months.\nRemaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions):\n \nCurrent\nNoncurrent\nTotal\nAs of January 31, 2025\n$\n30.2\n \n$\n33.2\n \n$\n63.4\n \nAs of January 31, 2024\n$\n27.6\n \n$\n29.3\n \n$\n56.9\n \n3. \nInvestments\nMarketable Securities\nAt January 31, 2025, marketable securities consisted of the following (in millions):\nAmortized\n\nCost\nUnrealized", "word_count": 6715, "token_count": 8373, "start_char": 755062, "end_char": 800657, "local_heads": [], "metadata_snapshot": {"doctype": "10-K", "date": "2015-08-31", "topic": "Agentforce|Data Cloud|Earnings|Partnership|Product", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm", "title": "crm-20250131", "company": "Salesforce", "persona_tags": ["cio", "vp_customer_experience", "vp_sales_ops"]}}

(the “Company”) is a global leader in customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together. With the deeply unified Salesforce Platform, the Company delivers a single source of truth, connecting customer data with integrated artificial intelligence (“AI”) across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and conduct commerce from anywhere. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company introduced Agentforce, a new layer of the trusted Salesforce Platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. Since its founding in 1999, the Company has pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and AI, enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the digital-first world.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:\n•\nthe standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;\n•\nthe valuation of privately-held strategic investments;\n•\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;\n•\nthe recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;\n•\nthe useful lives of intangible assets; and\n•\nthe fair value of certain stock awards issued.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses to be recognized.\n \nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nThe Company operates as \none\n operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions which have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company’s business operates in \none\n operating segment because most of the Company's service offerings operate on the Salesforce Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner, and the Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated net income basis. Additionally, the measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.\nThe Company’s significant segment expenses, which are the expenses included in operating income as well as losses on strategic investments, and other segment items, which includes other income (expense) and benefit from (provision for) income taxes, are included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, further components of the Company’s measure of profit or loss, which is net income, are included throughout the Company’s financial statements.\n65\nTable of Contents\nConcentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments\nThe Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company’s marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investment-grade securities and the Company’s policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n \nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were \n17\n percent and \n16\n percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were \n81\n percent and \n82\n percent of total assets, respectively.\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology st\nartups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately\n \n24\n percent o\nf the portfolio in the aggregate. As of \nJanuary 31, 2024\n, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately \n16\n percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. \nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company’s enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n•\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n•\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n•\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n•\nrecognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\nSubscription and Support Revenues\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement. \nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company’s subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized \n66\nTable of Contents\nat the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from software support and updates is recognized as the support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term.\nThe Company typically invoices its customers annually and its payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenues\nThe Company’s professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed price or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. Other revenues consist primarily of training revenues recognized as such services are performed.\nSignificant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple performance obligations such as Cloud Services, software licenses, support and updates and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are concluded to be distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\nCloud Services, software licenses and support and updates services are generally concluded to be distinct because such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company’s discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company’s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, the Company's go-to-market strategy, historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where the Company does not sell or price a product or service separately, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As the Company’s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\nIn certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when indicated by the distribution of its observable prices.\nAlternatively, the Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when the pricing practices or distribution of the observable prices are highly variable. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.\nCosts Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts related to noncancellable Cloud Services subscription, ongoing Cloud Services support and license support and updates. For contracts with term software licenses where revenue is recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer, costs allocable to those licenses are expensed as they are incurred. Capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Company’s direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Company’s employees and (4) to a lesser extent, success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence. \nCosts capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over \nfour years\n, which is longer than the typical initial contract period, but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors which included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid to partners over \ntwo years\n. \n67\nTable of Contents\nThe capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all noncancellable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. \nAmortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n There were \nno\n impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nThe Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. \nPrivately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations.\nPublicly held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, publicly held equity securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. In addition, the Company measures certain of its strategic investments, including its privately held debt and equity securities, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security or an impairment event.\n The additional disclosures regarding the Company’s fair value measurements are included in Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement.”\n68\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk associated with intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to minimize the Company’s exposure to balances primarily denominated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen. The Company’s derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the financial institutions with which it contracts for such derivatives, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty, thereby reducing risk of credit-related losses from a financial institutions' nonperformance. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. The notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024 was $\n10.7\n billion and $\n8.6\n billion, respectively. \nOutstanding foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts, as well as realized gains or losses from their net settlement, are recognized as other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations consistent with the offsetting gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement or settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows:\nBuildings and building improvements\n10\n to \n40\n years\nComputers, equipment and software\n3\n to \n5\n years\nFurniture and fixtures\n5\n years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of the estimated lease term or \n10\n years\nThe Company estimates the useful lives of property and equipment upon initial recognition and periodically evaluates the useful lives and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the useful lives.\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.\nLeases \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and classifies its leases at commencement. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Assets (also referred to as ROU assets) and liabilities recognized from finance leases are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less for any asset classes.\nLease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement, net of any future tenant incentives. The Company has lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to combine for all asset classes. As such, minimum lease payments include fixed payments for non-lease components within a lease agreement but exclude variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate, such as common area maintenance, operating expenses, utilities, or other costs that are subject to fluctuation from period to period. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. The Company reassesses the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within the control of the Company. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is an estimate of the interest rate the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in the economic environment where the leased asset is located.\nThe lease ROU asset is recognized based on the lease liability, adjusted for any rent payments or initial direct costs incurred or tenant incentives received prior to commencement. \n69\nTable of Contents\nLease expense for operating leases, which includes amortization expense of ROU assets, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization expense of finance lease ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense for finance lease liabilities is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate. Expense for variable lease payments is recognized as incurred.\nOn the lease commencement date, the Company also establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are included in property and equipment, net and are amortized over the lease term.\nThe Company has entered into subleases or has made decisions and taken actions to exit and sublease certain unoccupied leased office space. Similar to other long-lived assets discussed below, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a leased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease.\nIntangible Assets Acquired through Business Combinations\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.\nImpairment Assessment\nThe Company evaluates intangible assets and other long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to, significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. \nThe Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.\n \nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the event the Company acquires an entity with which the Company has a preexisting relationship, the Company will generally recognize a gain or loss to settle that relationship as of the acquisition date within operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. In the event that the Company acquires an entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and recorded within losses on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRestructuring \nThe Company generally recognizes employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable or when notification occurs, depending on the region an employee works. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred.\n \nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense is measured based on grant date at fair value using the grant date closing stock price for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards and using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and stock \n70\nTable of Contents\noptions on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of \nfour years\n. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates.\nThe Company grants performance share awards to executive officers and other members of senior management, which may include a market condition, a performance condition, or both. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market condition are measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the expense related to these awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a performance condition are measured based on the grant date closing stock price and the expense related to these awards is recognized based on the requisite service period elapsed, as well as the probability of achievement and estimated attainment of the performance condition as of the end of our reporting period.\nStock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP” or “2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan”) is measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is \n12\n months. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a \n15\n percent discount from the lower of the Company’s stock price on (i) the first day of the offering period or on (ii) the last day of the purchase period. The ESPP also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a \nsix-month\n purchase period (December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not to increase that election until the next one-year offering period. The ESPP includes a reset provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date.\nThe Company, at times, grants unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment. Therefore, the Company accounts for them as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards, based on the closing stock price on grant date, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally \nfour years\n.\n \nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising is expensed as incurred.\n Advertising expense was $\n1.0\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company’s tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company’s major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. \n71\nTable of Contents\ndollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nWarranties and Indemnification\nThe Company’s arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2025\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires additional operating segment disclosures in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 on a retrospective basis.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective or prospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires disaggregation of certain costs in a separate note to the financial statements, such as the amounts of employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, included in each relevant expense caption in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027 on a retrospective or prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2024-03 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n2. \nRevenues\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSubscription and Support Revenue by the Company's Service Offerings\nSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nSales \n$\n8,322\n \n$\n7,580\n \n$\n6,831\n \nService \n9,054\n \n8,245\n \n7,369\n \nPlatform and Other \n7,247\n \n6,611\n \n5,967\n \nMarketing and Commerce\n5,281\n \n4,912\n \n4,516\n \nIntegration and Analytics (1) \n5,775\n \n5,189\n \n4,338\n \n$\n35,679\n \n$\n32,537\n \n$\n29,021\n \n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company renamed the service offering previously referred to as Data to Integration and Analytics, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau. \n72\nTable of Contents\nTotal Revenue by Geographic Locations\nRevenues by geographical region consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nAmericas\n$\n25,143\n \n$\n23,289\n \n$\n21,250\n \nEurope\n8,891\n \n8,128\n \n7,163\n \nAsia Pacific\n3,861\n \n3,440\n \n2,939\n \n$\n37,895\n \n$\n34,857\n \n$\n31,352\n \nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Company's contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately \n93\n percent during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.\nContract Balances\nContract Assets\nThe Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. Contract assets were $\n724\n million as of January 31, 2025 as compared to $\n758\n million as of January 31, 2024, and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. \nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred or services have been provided. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable subscription agreements. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.\nThe change in unearned revenue was as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n2025\n2024\nUnearned revenue, beginning of period\n$\n19,003\n \n$\n17,376\n \nBillings and other (1)\n39,513\n \n36,370\n \nContribution from contract asset\n(\n34\n)\n110\n \nRevenue recognized over time\n(\n35,628\n)\n(\n32,727\n)\nRevenue recognized at a point in time\n(\n2,267\n)\n(\n2,130\n)\nUnearned revenue from business combinations\n156\n \n4\n \nUnearned revenue, end of period\n$\n20,743\n \n$\n19,003\n \n(1) Other includes, for example, the impact of foreign currency translation.\nRevenue recognized over time primarily includes Cloud Services subscription and support revenue, which is generally recognized ratably over time, and professional services and other revenue, which is generally recognized ratably or as delivered.\nRevenue recognized at a point in time substantially consists of term software licenses.\nApproximately \n50\n percent of total revenue recognized in fiscal 2025 was from the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2024.\nRemaining Performance Obligation \nRemaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is based on SSP. Remaining performance obligation is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of term license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is subject to future economic risks, including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe Company excludes amounts related to performance obligations from professional services contracts that are billed and recognized on a time and materials basis. \nThe majority of the Company's noncurrent remaining performance obligation is expected to be recognized in the next \n13\n to \n36\n months.\nRemaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions):\n \nCurrent\nNoncurrent\nTotal\nAs of January 31, 2025\n$\n30.2\n \n$\n33.2\n \n$\n63.4\n \nAs of January 31, 2024\n$\n27.6\n \n$\n29.3\n \n$\n56.9\n \n3. \nInvestments\nMarketable Securities\nAt January 31, 2025, marketable securities consisted of the following (in millions):\nAmortized\n\nCost\nUnrealized\n\nGains\nUnrealized", "word_count": 6717, "token_count": 8380, "start_char": 800657, "end_char": 846270, "local_heads": [], "metadata_snapshot": {"doctype": "10-K", "date": "2015-08-31", "topic": "Agentforce|Data Cloud|Earnings|Partnership|Product", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm", "title": "crm-20250131", "company": "Salesforce", "persona_tags": ["cio", "vp_customer_experience", "vp_sales_ops"]}}

(the “Company”) is a global leader in customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together. With the deeply unified Salesforce Platform, the Company delivers a single source of truth, connecting customer data with integrated artificial intelligence (“AI”) across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and conduct commerce from anywhere. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company introduced Agentforce, a new layer of the trusted Salesforce Platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. Since its founding in 1999, the Company has pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and AI, enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the digital-first world.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:\n•\nthe standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;\n•\nthe valuation of privately-held strategic investments;\n•\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;\n•\nthe recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;\n•\nthe useful lives of intangible assets; and\n•\nthe fair value of certain stock awards issued.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses to be recognized.\n \nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nThe Company operates as \none\n operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions which have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company’s business operates in \none\n operating segment because most of the Company's service offerings operate on the Salesforce Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner, and the Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated net income basis. Additionally, the measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.\nThe Company’s significant segment expenses, which are the expenses included in operating income as well as losses on strategic investments, and other segment items, which includes other income (expense) and benefit from (provision for) income taxes, are included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, further components of the Company’s measure of profit or loss, which is net income, are included throughout the Company’s financial statements.\n65\nTable of Contents\nConcentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments\nThe Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company’s marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investment-grade securities and the Company’s policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n \nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were \n17\n percent and \n16\n percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were \n81\n percent and \n82\n percent of total assets, respectively.\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology st\nartups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately\n \n24\n percent o\nf the portfolio in the aggregate. As of \nJanuary 31, 2024\n, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately \n16\n percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. \nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company’s enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n•\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n•\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n•\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n•\nrecognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\nSubscription and Support Revenues\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement. \nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company’s subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized \n66\nTable of Contents\nat the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from software support and updates is recognized as the support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term.\nThe Company typically invoices its customers annually and its payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenues\nThe Company’s professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed price or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. Other revenues consist primarily of training revenues recognized as such services are performed.\nSignificant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple performance obligations such as Cloud Services, software licenses, support and updates and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are concluded to be distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\nCloud Services, software licenses and support and updates services are generally concluded to be distinct because such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.\nThe Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company’s discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company’s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, the Company's go-to-market strategy, historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where the Company does not sell or price a product or service separately, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As the Company’s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\nIn certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when indicated by the distribution of its observable prices.\nAlternatively, the Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when the pricing practices or distribution of the observable prices are highly variable. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.\nCosts Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts related to noncancellable Cloud Services subscription, ongoing Cloud Services support and license support and updates. For contracts with term software licenses where revenue is recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer, costs allocable to those licenses are expensed as they are incurred. Capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Company’s direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Company’s employees and (4) to a lesser extent, success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence. \nCosts capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over \nfour years\n, which is longer than the typical initial contract period, but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors which included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid to partners over \ntwo years\n. \n67\nTable of Contents\nThe capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all noncancellable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. \nAmortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n There were \nno\n impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nThe Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. \nPrivately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations.\nPublicly held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, publicly held equity securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. In addition, the Company measures certain of its strategic investments, including its privately held debt and equity securities, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security or an impairment event.\n The additional disclosures regarding the Company’s fair value measurements are included in Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement.”\n68\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk associated with intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to minimize the Company’s exposure to balances primarily denominated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen. The Company’s derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the financial institutions with which it contracts for such derivatives, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty, thereby reducing risk of credit-related losses from a financial institutions' nonperformance. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. The notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024 was $\n10.7\n billion and $\n8.6\n billion, respectively. \nOutstanding foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts, as well as realized gains or losses from their net settlement, are recognized as other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations consistent with the offsetting gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement or settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows:\nBuildings and building improvements\n10\n to \n40\n years\nComputers, equipment and software\n3\n to \n5\n years\nFurniture and fixtures\n5\n years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of the estimated lease term or \n10\n years\nThe Company estimates the useful lives of property and equipment upon initial recognition and periodically evaluates the useful lives and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the useful lives.\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.\nLeases \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and classifies its leases at commencement. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Assets (also referred to as ROU assets) and liabilities recognized from finance leases are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less for any asset classes.\nLease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement, net of any future tenant incentives. The Company has lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to combine for all asset classes. As such, minimum lease payments include fixed payments for non-lease components within a lease agreement but exclude variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate, such as common area maintenance, operating expenses, utilities, or other costs that are subject to fluctuation from period to period. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. The Company reassesses the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within the control of the Company. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is an estimate of the interest rate the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in the economic environment where the leased asset is located.\nThe lease ROU asset is recognized based on the lease liability, adjusted for any rent payments or initial direct costs incurred or tenant incentives received prior to commencement. \n69\nTable of Contents\nLease expense for operating leases, which includes amortization expense of ROU assets, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization expense of finance lease ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense for finance lease liabilities is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate. Expense for variable lease payments is recognized as incurred.\nOn the lease commencement date, the Company also establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are included in property and equipment, net and are amortized over the lease term.\nThe Company has entered into subleases or has made decisions and taken actions to exit and sublease certain unoccupied leased office space. Similar to other long-lived assets discussed below, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a leased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease.\nIntangible Assets Acquired through Business Combinations\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.\nImpairment Assessment\nThe Company evaluates intangible assets and other long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to, significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. \nThe Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.\n \nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the event the Company acquires an entity with which the Company has a preexisting relationship, the Company will generally recognize a gain or loss to settle that relationship as of the acquisition date within operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. In the event that the Company acquires an entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and recorded within losses on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRestructuring \nThe Company generally recognizes employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable or when notification occurs, depending on the region an employee works. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred.\n \nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense is measured based on grant date at fair value using the grant date closing stock price for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards and using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and stock \n70\nTable of Contents\noptions on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of \nfour years\n. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates.\nThe Company grants performance share awards to executive officers and other members of senior management, which may include a market condition, a performance condition, or both. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market condition are measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the expense related to these awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a performance condition are measured based on the grant date closing stock price and the expense related to these awards is recognized based on the requisite service period elapsed, as well as the probability of achievement and estimated attainment of the performance condition as of the end of our reporting period.\nStock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP” or “2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan”) is measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is \n12\n months. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a \n15\n percent discount from the lower of the Company’s stock price on (i) the first day of the offering period or on (ii) the last day of the purchase period. The ESPP also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a \nsix-month\n purchase period (December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not to increase that election until the next one-year offering period. The ESPP includes a reset provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date.\nThe Company, at times, grants unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment. Therefore, the Company accounts for them as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards, based on the closing stock price on grant date, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally \nfour years\n.\n \nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising is expensed as incurred.\n Advertising expense was $\n1.0\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company’s tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company’s major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. \n71\nTable of Contents\ndollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nWarranties and Indemnification\nThe Company’s arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2025\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires additional operating segment disclosures in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 on a retrospective basis.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective or prospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires disaggregation of certain costs in a separate note to the financial statements, such as the amounts of employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, included in each relevant expense caption in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027 on a retrospective or prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2024-03 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n2. \nRevenues\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSubscription and Support Revenue by the Company's Service Offerings\nSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nSales \n$\n8,322\n \n$\n7,580\n \n$\n6,831\n \nService \n9,054\n \n8,245\n \n7,369\n \nPlatform and Other \n7,247\n \n6,611\n \n5,967\n \nMarketing and Commerce\n5,281\n \n4,912\n \n4,516\n \nIntegration and Analytics (1) \n5,775\n \n5,189\n \n4,338\n \n$\n35,679\n \n$\n32,537\n \n$\n29,021\n \n(1) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company renamed the service offering previously referred to as Data to Integration and Analytics, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau. \n72\nTable of Contents\nTotal Revenue by Geographic Locations\nRevenues by geographical region consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nAmericas\n$\n25,143\n \n$\n23,289\n \n$\n21,250\n \nEurope\n8,891\n \n8,128\n \n7,163\n \nAsia Pacific\n3,861\n \n3,440\n \n2,939\n \n$\n37,895\n \n$\n34,857\n \n$\n31,352\n \nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Company's contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately \n93\n percent during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.\nContract Balances\nContract Assets\nThe Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. Contract assets were $\n724\n million as of January 31, 2025 as compared to $\n758\n million as of January 31, 2024, and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. \nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred or services have been provided. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable subscription agreements. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.\nThe change in unearned revenue was as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n2025\n2024\nUnearned revenue, beginning of period\n$\n19,003\n \n$\n17,376\n \nBillings and other (1)\n39,513\n \n36,370\n \nContribution from contract asset\n(\n34\n)\n110\n \nRevenue recognized over time\n(\n35,628\n)\n(\n32,727\n)\nRevenue recognized at a point in time\n(\n2,267\n)\n(\n2,130\n)\nUnearned revenue from business combinations\n156\n \n4\n \nUnearned revenue, end of period\n$\n20,743\n \n$\n19,003\n \n(1) Other includes, for example, the impact of foreign currency translation.\nRevenue recognized over time primarily includes Cloud Services subscription and support revenue, which is generally recognized ratably over time, and professional services and other revenue, which is generally recognized ratably or as delivered.\nRevenue recognized at a point in time substantially consists of term software licenses.\nApproximately \n50\n percent of total revenue recognized in fiscal 2025 was from the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2024.\nRemaining Performance Obligation \nRemaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is based on SSP. Remaining performance obligation is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of term license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates.

The estimation of fair value for these investments requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, and as a result, the Company deems these assets as Level 3 within the fair value measurement framework. For privately held equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, the Company applies valuation methods based on information available, including the market approach and option pricing models (“OPM”). Observable transactions, such as the issuance of new equity by an investee, are indicators of investee enterprise value and are used to estimate the fair value of the privately held equity investments. An OPM may be utilized to allocate value to the various classes of securities of the investee, including classes owned by the Company. Such information, available to the Company from investee companies, is supplemented with estimates such as volatility, expected time to liquidity and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds. When indicators of impairment are observed for privately held equity securities, the Company generally uses the market approach to estimate the fair value of its investment, giving consideration to the latest observable transactions, as well as the investee's current and projected financial performance and other significant inputs and assumptions, including estimated time to exit, selection and analysis of guideline public companies and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds. The Company's privately held debt and equity securities and other investments amounted to $\n4.8\n billion and $\n4.8\n billion as of January 31, 2025\n and \nJanuary 31, 2024, respectively.\n5. \nProperty and Equipment, Net and Other Balance Sheet Accounts\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nAs of January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\nLand \n$\n293\n \n$\n293\n \nBuildings and building improvements \n492\n \n490\n \nComputers, equipment and software\n4,345\n \n4,209\n \nFurniture and fixtures\n232\n \n245\n \nLeasehold improvements\n1,556\n \n1,604\n \nProperty and equipment, gross\n6,918\n \n6,841\n \nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n(\n3,682\n)\n(\n3,152\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n3,236\n \n$\n3,689\n \nDepreciation and amortization expense totaled $\n1.0\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n903\n million during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther Balance Sheet Accounts\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities as of January 31, 2025 included approximately $\n2.8\n billion of accrued compensation as compared to $\n2.5\n billion as of January 31, 2024.\n6. \nLeases and Other Commitments\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases for corporate offices, data centers and equipment under noncancellable operating and finance leases with various expiration dates.

Observable transactions, such as the issuance of new equity by an investee, are indicators of investee enterprise value and are used to estimate the fair value of the privately held equity investments. An OPM may be utilized to allocate value to the various classes of securities of the investee, including classes owned by the Company. Such information, available to the Company from investee companies, is supplemented with estimates such as volatility, expected time to liquidity and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds. When indicators of impairment are observed for privately held equity securities, the Company generally uses the market approach to estimate the fair value of its investment, giving consideration to the latest observable transactions, as well as the investee's current and projected financial performance and other significant inputs and assumptions, including estimated time to exit, selection and analysis of guideline public companies and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds. The Company's privately held debt and equity securities and other investments amounted to $\n4.8\n billion and $\n4.8\n billion as of January 31, 2025\n and \nJanuary 31, 2024, respectively.\n5. \nProperty and Equipment, Net and Other Balance Sheet Accounts\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in millions):\n \nAs of January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\nLand \n$\n293\n \n$\n293\n \nBuildings and building improvements \n492\n \n490\n \nComputers, equipment and software\n4,345\n \n4,209\n \nFurniture and fixtures\n232\n \n245\n \nLeasehold improvements\n1,556\n \n1,604\n \nProperty and equipment, gross\n6,918\n \n6,841\n \nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n(\n3,682\n)\n(\n3,152\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n3,236\n \n$\n3,689\n \nDepreciation and amortization expense totaled $\n1.0\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n903\n million during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther Balance Sheet Accounts\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities as of January 31, 2025 included approximately $\n2.8\n billion of accrued compensation as compared to $\n2.5\n billion as of January 31, 2024.\n6. \nLeases and Other Commitments\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases for corporate offices, data centers and equipment under noncancellable operating and finance leases with various expiration dates.

The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on the achievement of a market-based condition and a service-based condition or a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the service periods, which range from approximately \none\n-year to \nfour\n-years, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between \n0\n and \n200\n percent, depending on the extent the market-based condition or performance-based condition, or both, are achieved.\nThe aggregate expected stock-based compensation expense remaining to be recognized as of January 31, 2025 was as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Period:\nFiscal 2026\n$\n2,602\n \nFiscal 2027\n1,717\n \nFiscal 2028\n1,083\n \nFiscal 2029\n182\n \nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n5,584\n \nThe aggregate expected stock-based compensation expense remaining to be recognized reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2025 and assumes no forfeiture activity and no changes in the expected level of attainment of performance share grants based on the Company’s financial performance relative to certain targets.\n85\nTable of Contents\nCommon Stock\nThe following number of shares of common stock were reserved and available for future issuance at January 31, 2025 (in millions):\nOptions outstanding\n8\n \nRestricted stock awards and units and performance-based stock units outstanding\n26\n \nStock available for future grant or issuance:\n2013 Equity Incentive Plan\n73\n \n2014 Inducement Plan\n1\n \nAmended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n13\n \n121\n \nPreferred Stock\nThe Company’s board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to \n5,000,000\n shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Company’s board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Company’s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, \nno\n shares of preferred stock were outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn August 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $\n10.0\n billion of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). In February 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $\n10.0\n billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $\n10.0\n billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program for an aggregate total authorization of $\n30.0\n billion. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Share Repurchase Program, shares of common stock may be repurchased using a variety of methods, including privately negotiated and or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as part of accelerated share repurchases and other methods. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the Company in its discretion and depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method.\nThe Company repurchased the following under its Share Repurchase Program (in millions, except average price per share):\n2025\n2024\n2023\nShares\nAverage price per share\nAmount\nShares\nAverage price per share\nAmount\nShares\nAverage price per share\nAmount\nFiscal year ended January 31\n30\n \n$\n260.12\n \n$\n7,757\n \n36\n \n$\n210.30\n \n$\n7,674\n \n28\n \n$\n144.94\n \n$\n4,000\n \nAll repurchases were made in open market transactions.

The Company had California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n480\n million which expire beginning in fiscal 2029 through fiscal 2045, California research and development tax credits of approximately $\n932\n million, which do not expire. For other states' income tax purposes, the Company had tax credits of approximately $\n75\n million, which expire beginning in fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2034, and insignificant net operating loss carryforwards. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.\nThe Company had a valuation allowance of $\n786\n million and $\n733\n million as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable jurisdictions. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to state tax credits and certain U.S foreign tax credits that are not expected to be realized. At the end of January 31, 2025, the valuation allowance was primarily related to U.S. states’ net operating loss and tax credits and certain U.S foreign tax credits. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations\nThe Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. \n88\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nBeginning of period\n$\n2,083\n \n$\n1,975\n \n$\n1,822\n \nTax positions taken in prior period:\nGross increases\n53\n \n53\n \n53\n \nGross decreases\n(\n65\n)\n(\n85\n)\n(\n45\n)\nTax positions taken in current period:\nGross increases\n378\n \n287\n \n227\n \nSettlements\n(\n4\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n40\n)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(\n25\n)\n(\n104\n)\n(\n12\n)\nCurrency translation effect\n(\n1\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n30\n)\nEnd of period\n$\n2,419\n \n$\n2,083\n \n$\n1,975\n \nIn fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company reported a net increase of approximately $\n336\n million, $\n108\n million, and $\n153\n million, respectively, in its unrecognized tax benefits. For fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $\n1.7\n billion, $\n1.7\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion, respectively, if recognized, would have reduced income tax expense and the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe Company has recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of $\n89\n million, $\n29\n million and $\n48\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, were $\n225\n million, $\n136\n million and $\n107\n million, respectively. \nCertain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in major tax jurisdictions including the United States, Germany and Israel. The Company currently considers U.S. federal, Japan, Australia, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, India and Israel to be major tax jurisdictions. The Company’s U.S. federal tax returns since fiscal 2008 remain open to examination, and non-U.S. tax returns generally remain open to examination since fiscal 2019. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. As the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, if any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future.\nThe Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that an insignificant decrease of its unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the next 12 months, as the applicable statutes of limitations lapse, ongoing examinations are completed, or tax positions meet the conditions of being effectively settled.\n13. \nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted net income per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method.\nA reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share is as follows (in millions):\n4\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nNumerator:\nNet income\n$\n6,197\n \n$\n4,136\n \n$\n208\n \nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding for basic net income per share\n962\n \n974\n \n992\n \nEffect of dilutive securities:\nEmployee stock awards\n12\n \n10\n \n5\n \nWeighted-average shares outstanding for diluted net income per share\n974\n \n984\n \n997\n \n89\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted net income per share does not include the effect of the following potentially outstanding common stock. \nThe effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nEmployee stock awards\n7\n \n13\n \n39\n \n14. \nLegal Proceedings and Claims\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. \nIn general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company’s financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company’s reputation and future operating results.\nThe Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company’s estimates may not prove to be accurate. \nIn management’s opinion, resolution of all current matters, including those described below, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, payment or other contingency, the resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company’s current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.\nSlack Litigation\nBeginning in September 2019, \nseven\n purported class action lawsuits were filed against Slack, its directors, certain of its officers and certain investment funds associated with certain of its directors, each alleging violations of securities laws in connection with Slack’s registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) filed with the SEC. All but one of these actions were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, though one plaintiff originally filed in the County of San Francisco before refiling in the County of San Mateo (and the original San Francisco action was dismissed). The remaining action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Federal Action”). In the Federal Action, captioned Dennee v. Slack Technologies, Inc., Case No. 3:19-CV-05857-SI, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2020. In April 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In May 2020, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to certify the court’s order for interlocutory appeal, which the court granted. Slack and the other defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the district court’s order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. Oral argument was heard in May 2021. On September 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling. Slack filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on November 3, 2021, which was denied on May 2, 2022. Slack filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 31, 2022, which was granted on December 13, 2022. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision vacating the Ninth Circuit’s decision and remanded for further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ordered the parties to submit additional briefing in light of the Supreme Court’s decision. On February 10, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court’s order and instructing the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The state court actions were consolidated in November 2019, and the consolidated action is captioned In re Slack Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CIV05370 (the “State Court Action”). An additional state court action was filed in San Mateo County in June 2020 but was consolidated with the State Court Action in July 2020. Slack and the other defendants filed demurrers to the complaint in the State Court Action in February 2020. In August 2020, the court sustained in part and overruled in part the demurrers, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which they filed in October 2020. Slack and the other defendants answered the complaint in November 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on October 21, 2021, which remains pending. On October 26, 2022, the court stayed the State Court Action pending resolution of Slack’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Federal Action. The State Court Action remains stayed pending resolution of the appellate proceedings in the Federal Action. The Federal Action and the State Court Action seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief on \n90\nTable of Contents\nbehalf of investors who purchased Slack’s Class A common stock issued pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement.\nBackpage Litigation \nThe Company has been named as a defendant in a number of state and federal actions relating to the activities of one of its former customers, Website Technologies, LLC (“Website Technologies”), an affiliate of Backpage.com, LLC (“Backpage”). Plaintiffs in these actions generally allege that they were victims of sex trafficking by individuals who advertised them on backpage.com, a website operated by Backpage, and assert various claims and theories premised on the Company’s provision to Website Technologies of Salesforce CRM Software and related products, which the plaintiffs allege facilitated the operation and growth of Backpage’s business. The initial action, filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Francisco on behalf of numerous plaintiffs, was dismissed with prejudice under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”), and that dismissal was affirmed by the California Court of Appeal in December 2021. In April 2020, an action was filed on behalf of a single plaintiff in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The district court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the action, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling in August 2023. The court has scheduled trial in that matter for June 2026. Beginning in April 2020, \nfive\n actions involving \nsix\n plaintiffs were filed and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas as A.B. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 4:20-CV-01254. The Company moved for summary judgment on the basis that the claims were barred by Section 230. In November 2023, the court denied the Company’s motion and in December 2024, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling. Beginning in May 2023, a number of similar actions have been filed in Texas federal and state courts, including principally: (1) \n30\n actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which were consolidated as S.M.A. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 3:23-CV-0915-B (“S.M.A”); (2) \n21\n actions filed in Texas state court in Dallas County, which were removed by the Company to the Northern District of Texas, and consolidated as A.S. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 3:23-CV-1039-B (“A.S.”); and (3) \none\n action filed in Texas state court in Harris County, which was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas as T.S. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 4:23-CV-01792 (“T.S.”). Separately, \n19\n actions have been filed in Texas state court, which are proceeding in a Texas state court multidistrict litigation in Harris County District Court, captioned In re Jane Doe Cases, MDL 2020-28545. In March 2024, the district court in S.M.A. granted the Company’s consolidated motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs had not alleged the requisite intent element under the federal trafficking statute, and in April 2024 an amended complaint was filed amending the federal law claim and adding a Texas state law claim. In May 2024, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In September 2024, the district court in A.S. denied the Company’s motion to dismiss and the court has scheduled trial for November 2025. In November 2024, the Company moved for judgment on the pleadings in A.S. In June 2023, the Company moved to dismiss the T.S. action, and that motion remains pending. Plaintiffs’ counsel in these actions have stated that they represent several hundred additional possible claimants. All of the foregoing actions seek unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The Company intends to defend its interests in these proceedings vigorously.\n \n91\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level, that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on the guidelines established in the \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Audit Committee.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n(d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate \n92\nTable of Contents\nbecause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nITEM 9B.     OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended January 31, 2025, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) informed us of the \nadoption\n or \ntermination\n of a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K), except as follows. \nOn \nDecember 17, 2024\n, \nParker Harris\n, \nCo-Founder and Chief Technology Officer\n, Slack, \nadopted\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to \n150,662\n shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain conditions, through \nDecember 15, 2025\n (or the date all shares are sold under the arrangement, if earlier).\n \nOn \nJanuary 9, 2025\n, \nMarc Benioff\n, \nChair and Chief Executive Officer\n, \nadopted\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to \n353,684\n shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain conditions, through \nMarch 20, 2026\n (or the date all shares are sold under the arrangement, if earlier).", "word_count": 5049, "token_count": 7275, "start_char": 1063012, "end_char": 1095033, "local_heads": [], "metadata_snapshot": {"doctype": "10-K", "date": "2015-08-31", "topic": "Agentforce|Data Cloud|Earnings|Partnership|Product", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm", "title": "crm-20250131", "company": "Salesforce", "persona_tags": ["cio", "vp_customer_experience", "vp_sales_ops"]}}

At the end of the service periods, which range from approximately \none\n-year to \nfour\n-years, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between \n0\n and \n200\n percent, depending on the extent the market-based condition or performance-based condition, or both, are achieved.\nThe aggregate expected stock-based compensation expense remaining to be recognized as of January 31, 2025 was as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Period:\nFiscal 2026\n$\n2,602\n \nFiscal 2027\n1,717\n \nFiscal 2028\n1,083\n \nFiscal 2029\n182\n \nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n5,584\n \nThe aggregate expected stock-based compensation expense remaining to be recognized reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2025 and assumes no forfeiture activity and no changes in the expected level of attainment of performance share grants based on the Company’s financial performance relative to certain targets.\n85\nTable of Contents\nCommon Stock\nThe following number of shares of common stock were reserved and available for future issuance at January 31, 2025 (in millions):\nOptions outstanding\n8\n \nRestricted stock awards and units and performance-based stock units outstanding\n26\n \nStock available for future grant or issuance:\n2013 Equity Incentive Plan\n73\n \n2014 Inducement Plan\n1\n \nAmended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n13\n \n121\n \nPreferred Stock\nThe Company’s board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to \n5,000,000\n shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Company’s board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Company’s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, \nno\n shares of preferred stock were outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn August 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $\n10.0\n billion of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). In February 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $\n10.0\n billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $\n10.0\n billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program for an aggregate total authorization of $\n30.0\n billion. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Share Repurchase Program, shares of common stock may be repurchased using a variety of methods, including privately negotiated and or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as part of accelerated share repurchases and other methods. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the Company in its discretion and depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions.

The Company had California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n480\n million which expire beginning in fiscal 2029 through fiscal 2045, California research and development tax credits of approximately $\n932\n million, which do not expire. For other states' income tax purposes, the Company had tax credits of approximately $\n75\n million, which expire beginning in fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2034, and insignificant net operating loss carryforwards. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.\nThe Company had a valuation allowance of $\n786\n million and $\n733\n million as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable jurisdictions. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to state tax credits and certain U.S foreign tax credits that are not expected to be realized. At the end of January 31, 2025, the valuation allowance was primarily related to U.S. states’ net operating loss and tax credits and certain U.S foreign tax credits. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations\nThe Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. \n88\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nBeginning of period\n$\n2,083\n \n$\n1,975\n \n$\n1,822\n \nTax positions taken in prior period:\nGross increases\n53\n \n53\n \n53\n \nGross decreases\n(\n65\n)\n(\n85\n)\n(\n45\n)\nTax positions taken in current period:\nGross increases\n378\n \n287\n \n227\n \nSettlements\n(\n4\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n40\n)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(\n25\n)\n(\n104\n)\n(\n12\n)\nCurrency translation effect\n(\n1\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n30\n)\nEnd of period\n$\n2,419\n \n$\n2,083\n \n$\n1,975\n \nIn fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company reported a net increase of approximately $\n336\n million, $\n108\n million, and $\n153\n million, respectively, in its unrecognized tax benefits. For fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $\n1.7\n billion, $\n1.7\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion, respectively, if recognized, would have reduced income tax expense and the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe Company has recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of $\n89\n million, $\n29\n million and $\n48\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, were $\n225\n million, $\n136\n million and $\n107\n million, respectively. \nCertain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in major tax jurisdictions including the United States, Germany and Israel. The Company currently considers U.S. federal, Japan, Australia, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, India and Israel to be major tax jurisdictions. The Company’s U.S. federal tax returns since fiscal 2008 remain open to examination, and non-U.S. tax returns generally remain open to examination since fiscal 2019. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. As the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, if any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future.\nThe Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that an insignificant decrease of its unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the next 12 months, as the applicable statutes of limitations lapse, ongoing examinations are completed, or tax positions meet the conditions of being effectively settled.\n13. \nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted net income per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method.\nA reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share is as follows (in millions):\n4\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nNumerator:\nNet income\n$\n6,197\n \n$\n4,136\n \n$\n208\n \nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding for basic net income per share\n962\n \n974\n \n992\n \nEffect of dilutive securities:\nEmployee stock awards\n12\n \n10\n \n5\n \nWeighted-average shares outstanding for diluted net income per share\n974\n \n984\n \n997\n \n89\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted net income per share does not include the effect of the following potentially outstanding common stock. \nThe effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nEmployee stock awards\n7\n \n13\n \n39\n \n14. \nLegal Proceedings and Claims\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. \nIn general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company’s financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company’s reputation and future operating results.\nThe Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company’s estimates may not prove to be accurate. \nIn management’s opinion, resolution of all current matters, including those described below, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, payment or other contingency, the resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company’s current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.\nSlack Litigation\nBeginning in September 2019, \nseven\n purported class action lawsuits were filed against Slack, its directors, certain of its officers and certain investment funds associated with certain of its directors, each alleging violations of securities laws in connection with Slack’s registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) filed with the SEC. All but one of these actions were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, though one plaintiff originally filed in the County of San Francisco before refiling in the County of San Mateo (and the original San Francisco action was dismissed). The remaining action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Federal Action”). In the Federal Action, captioned Dennee v. Slack Technologies, Inc., Case No. 3:19-CV-05857-SI, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2020. In April 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In May 2020, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to certify the court’s order for interlocutory appeal, which the court granted. Slack and the other defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the district court’s order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. Oral argument was heard in May 2021. On September 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling. Slack filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on November 3, 2021, which was denied on May 2, 2022. Slack filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 31, 2022, which was granted on December 13, 2022. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision vacating the Ninth Circuit’s decision and remanded for further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ordered the parties to submit additional briefing in light of the Supreme Court’s decision. On February 10, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court’s order and instructing the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The state court actions were consolidated in November 2019, and the consolidated action is captioned In re Slack Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CIV05370 (the “State Court Action”). An additional state court action was filed in San Mateo County in June 2020 but was consolidated with the State Court Action in July 2020. Slack and the other defendants filed demurrers to the complaint in the State Court Action in February 2020. In August 2020, the court sustained in part and overruled in part the demurrers, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which they filed in October 2020. Slack and the other defendants answered the complaint in November 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on October 21, 2021, which remains pending. On October 26, 2022, the court stayed the State Court Action pending resolution of Slack’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Federal Action. The State Court Action remains stayed pending resolution of the appellate proceedings in the Federal Action. The Federal Action and the State Court Action seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief on \n90\nTable of Contents\nbehalf of investors who purchased Slack’s Class A common stock issued pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement.\nBackpage Litigation \nThe Company has been named as a defendant in a number of state and federal actions relating to the activities of one of its former customers, Website Technologies, LLC (“Website Technologies”), an affiliate of Backpage.com, LLC (“Backpage”). Plaintiffs in these actions generally allege that they were victims of sex trafficking by individuals who advertised them on backpage.com, a website operated by Backpage, and assert various claims and theories premised on the Company’s provision to Website Technologies of Salesforce CRM Software and related products, which the plaintiffs allege facilitated the operation and growth of Backpage’s business. The initial action, filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Francisco on behalf of numerous plaintiffs, was dismissed with prejudice under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”), and that dismissal was affirmed by the California Court of Appeal in December 2021. In April 2020, an action was filed on behalf of a single plaintiff in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The district court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the action, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling in August 2023. The court has scheduled trial in that matter for June 2026. Beginning in April 2020, \nfive\n actions involving \nsix\n plaintiffs were filed and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas as A.B. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 4:20-CV-01254. The Company moved for summary judgment on the basis that the claims were barred by Section 230. In November 2023, the court denied the Company’s motion and in December 2024, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling. Beginning in May 2023, a number of similar actions have been filed in Texas federal and state courts, including principally: (1) \n30\n actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which were consolidated as S.M.A. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 3:23-CV-0915-B (“S.M.A”); (2) \n21\n actions filed in Texas state court in Dallas County, which were removed by the Company to the Northern District of Texas, and consolidated as A.S. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 3:23-CV-1039-B (“A.S.”); and (3) \none\n action filed in Texas state court in Harris County, which was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas as T.S. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 4:23-CV-01792 (“T.S.”). Separately, \n19\n actions have been filed in Texas state court, which are proceeding in a Texas state court multidistrict litigation in Harris County District Court, captioned In re Jane Doe Cases, MDL 2020-28545. In March 2024, the district court in S.M.A. granted the Company’s consolidated motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs had not alleged the requisite intent element under the federal trafficking statute, and in April 2024 an amended complaint was filed amending the federal law claim and adding a Texas state law claim. In May 2024, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In September 2024, the district court in A.S. denied the Company’s motion to dismiss and the court has scheduled trial for November 2025. In November 2024, the Company moved for judgment on the pleadings in A.S. In June 2023, the Company moved to dismiss the T.S. action, and that motion remains pending. Plaintiffs’ counsel in these actions have stated that they represent several hundred additional possible claimants. All of the foregoing actions seek unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The Company intends to defend its interests in these proceedings vigorously.\n \n91\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level, that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on the guidelines established in the \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Audit Committee.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n(d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate \n92\nTable of Contents\nbecause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nITEM 9B.     OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended January 31, 2025, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) informed us of the \nadoption\n or \ntermination\n of a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K), except as follows. \nOn \nDecember 17, 2024\n, \nParker Harris\n, \nCo-Founder and Chief Technology Officer\n, Slack, \nadopted\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to \n150,662\n shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain conditions, through \nDecember 15, 2025\n (or the date all shares are sold under the arrangement, if earlier).\n \nOn \nJanuary 9, 2025\n, \nMarc Benioff\n, \nChair and Chief Executive Officer\n, \nadopted\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to \n353,684\n shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain conditions, through \nMarch 20, 2026\n (or the date all shares are sold under the arrangement, if earlier).\n\nITEM 9C.

The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on the achievement of a market-based condition and a service-based condition or a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the service periods, which range from approximately \none\n-year to \nfour\n-years, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between \n0\n and \n200\n percent, depending on the extent the market-based condition or performance-based condition, or both, are achieved.\nThe aggregate expected stock-based compensation expense remaining to be recognized as of January 31, 2025 was as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Period:\nFiscal 2026\n$\n2,602\n \nFiscal 2027\n1,717\n \nFiscal 2028\n1,083\n \nFiscal 2029\n182\n \nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n5,584\n \nThe aggregate expected stock-based compensation expense remaining to be recognized reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2025 and assumes no forfeiture activity and no changes in the expected level of attainment of performance share grants based on the Company’s financial performance relative to certain targets.\n85\nTable of Contents\nCommon Stock\nThe following number of shares of common stock were reserved and available for future issuance at January 31, 2025 (in millions):\nOptions outstanding\n8\n \nRestricted stock awards and units and performance-based stock units outstanding\n26\n \nStock available for future grant or issuance:\n2013 Equity Incentive Plan\n73\n \n2014 Inducement Plan\n1\n \nAmended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n13\n \n121\n \nPreferred Stock\nThe Company’s board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to \n5,000,000\n shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Company’s board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Company’s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, \nno\n shares of preferred stock were outstanding.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn August 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $\n10.0\n billion of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). In February 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $\n10.0\n billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $\n10.0\n billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program for an aggregate total authorization of $\n30.0\n billion. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Share Repurchase Program, shares of common stock may be repurchased using a variety of methods, including privately negotiated and or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as part of accelerated share repurchases and other methods.

The Company had California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n480\n million which expire beginning in fiscal 2029 through fiscal 2045, California research and development tax credits of approximately $\n932\n million, which do not expire. For other states' income tax purposes, the Company had tax credits of approximately $\n75\n million, which expire beginning in fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2034, and insignificant net operating loss carryforwards. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.\nThe Company had a valuation allowance of $\n786\n million and $\n733\n million as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable jurisdictions. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to state tax credits and certain U.S foreign tax credits that are not expected to be realized. At the end of January 31, 2025, the valuation allowance was primarily related to U.S. states’ net operating loss and tax credits and certain U.S foreign tax credits. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations\nThe Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. \n88\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nBeginning of period\n$\n2,083\n \n$\n1,975\n \n$\n1,822\n \nTax positions taken in prior period:\nGross increases\n53\n \n53\n \n53\n \nGross decreases\n(\n65\n)\n(\n85\n)\n(\n45\n)\nTax positions taken in current period:\nGross increases\n378\n \n287\n \n227\n \nSettlements\n(\n4\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n40\n)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(\n25\n)\n(\n104\n)\n(\n12\n)\nCurrency translation effect\n(\n1\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n30\n)\nEnd of period\n$\n2,419\n \n$\n2,083\n \n$\n1,975\n \nIn fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company reported a net increase of approximately $\n336\n million, $\n108\n million, and $\n153\n million, respectively, in its unrecognized tax benefits. For fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $\n1.7\n billion, $\n1.7\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion, respectively, if recognized, would have reduced income tax expense and the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe Company has recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of $\n89\n million, $\n29\n million and $\n48\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, were $\n225\n million, $\n136\n million and $\n107\n million, respectively. \nCertain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in major tax jurisdictions including the United States, Germany and Israel. The Company currently considers U.S. federal, Japan, Australia, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, India and Israel to be major tax jurisdictions. The Company’s U.S. federal tax returns since fiscal 2008 remain open to examination, and non-U.S. tax returns generally remain open to examination since fiscal 2019. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. As the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, if any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future.\nThe Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that an insignificant decrease of its unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the next 12 months, as the applicable statutes of limitations lapse, ongoing examinations are completed, or tax positions meet the conditions of being effectively settled.\n13. \nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted net income per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method.\nA reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share is as follows (in millions):\n4\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nNumerator:\nNet income\n$\n6,197\n \n$\n4,136\n \n$\n208\n \nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding for basic net income per share\n962\n \n974\n \n992\n \nEffect of dilutive securities:\nEmployee stock awards\n12\n \n10\n \n5\n \nWeighted-average shares outstanding for diluted net income per share\n974\n \n984\n \n997\n \n89\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted net income per share does not include the effect of the following potentially outstanding common stock. \nThe effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in millions):\n \nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nEmployee stock awards\n7\n \n13\n \n39\n \n14. \nLegal Proceedings and Claims\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. \nIn general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company’s financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company’s reputation and future operating results.\nThe Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company’s estimates may not prove to be accurate. \nIn management’s opinion, resolution of all current matters, including those described below, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, payment or other contingency, the resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company’s current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.\nSlack Litigation\nBeginning in September 2019, \nseven\n purported class action lawsuits were filed against Slack, its directors, certain of its officers and certain investment funds associated with certain of its directors, each alleging violations of securities laws in connection with Slack’s registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) filed with the SEC. All but one of these actions were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, though one plaintiff originally filed in the County of San Francisco before refiling in the County of San Mateo (and the original San Francisco action was dismissed). The remaining action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Federal Action”). In the Federal Action, captioned Dennee v. Slack Technologies, Inc., Case No. 3:19-CV-05857-SI, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2020. In April 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In May 2020, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to certify the court’s order for interlocutory appeal, which the court granted. Slack and the other defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the district court’s order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. Oral argument was heard in May 2021. On September 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling. Slack filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on November 3, 2021, which was denied on May 2, 2022. Slack filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 31, 2022, which was granted on December 13, 2022. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision vacating the Ninth Circuit’s decision and remanded for further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ordered the parties to submit additional briefing in light of the Supreme Court’s decision. On February 10, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court’s order and instructing the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The state court actions were consolidated in November 2019, and the consolidated action is captioned In re Slack Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CIV05370 (the “State Court Action”). An additional state court action was filed in San Mateo County in June 2020 but was consolidated with the State Court Action in July 2020. Slack and the other defendants filed demurrers to the complaint in the State Court Action in February 2020. In August 2020, the court sustained in part and overruled in part the demurrers, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which they filed in October 2020. Slack and the other defendants answered the complaint in November 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on October 21, 2021, which remains pending. On October 26, 2022, the court stayed the State Court Action pending resolution of Slack’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Federal Action. The State Court Action remains stayed pending resolution of the appellate proceedings in the Federal Action. The Federal Action and the State Court Action seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief on \n90\nTable of Contents\nbehalf of investors who purchased Slack’s Class A common stock issued pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement.\nBackpage Litigation \nThe Company has been named as a defendant in a number of state and federal actions relating to the activities of one of its former customers, Website Technologies, LLC (“Website Technologies”), an affiliate of Backpage.com, LLC (“Backpage”). Plaintiffs in these actions generally allege that they were victims of sex trafficking by individuals who advertised them on backpage.com, a website operated by Backpage, and assert various claims and theories premised on the Company’s provision to Website Technologies of Salesforce CRM Software and related products, which the plaintiffs allege facilitated the operation and growth of Backpage’s business. The initial action, filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Francisco on behalf of numerous plaintiffs, was dismissed with prejudice under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”), and that dismissal was affirmed by the California Court of Appeal in December 2021. In April 2020, an action was filed on behalf of a single plaintiff in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The district court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the action, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling in August 2023. The court has scheduled trial in that matter for June 2026. Beginning in April 2020, \nfive\n actions involving \nsix\n plaintiffs were filed and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas as A.B. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 4:20-CV-01254. The Company moved for summary judgment on the basis that the claims were barred by Section 230. In November 2023, the court denied the Company’s motion and in December 2024, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling. Beginning in May 2023, a number of similar actions have been filed in Texas federal and state courts, including principally: (1) \n30\n actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which were consolidated as S.M.A. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 3:23-CV-0915-B (“S.M.A”); (2) \n21\n actions filed in Texas state court in Dallas County, which were removed by the Company to the Northern District of Texas, and consolidated as A.S. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 3:23-CV-1039-B (“A.S.”); and (3) \none\n action filed in Texas state court in Harris County, which was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas as T.S. v. Salesforce, Inc., Case No. 4:23-CV-01792 (“T.S.”). Separately, \n19\n actions have been filed in Texas state court, which are proceeding in a Texas state court multidistrict litigation in Harris County District Court, captioned In re Jane Doe Cases, MDL 2020-28545. In March 2024, the district court in S.M.A. granted the Company’s consolidated motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs had not alleged the requisite intent element under the federal trafficking statute, and in April 2024 an amended complaint was filed amending the federal law claim and adding a Texas state law claim. In May 2024, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In September 2024, the district court in A.S. denied the Company’s motion to dismiss and the court has scheduled trial for November 2025. In November 2024, the Company moved for judgment on the pleadings in A.S. In June 2023, the Company moved to dismiss the T.S. action, and that motion remains pending. Plaintiffs’ counsel in these actions have stated that they represent several hundred additional possible claimants. All of the foregoing actions seek unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The Company intends to defend its interests in these proceedings vigorously.\n \n91\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level, that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on the guidelines established in the \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Audit Committee.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n(d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate \n92\nTable of Contents\nbecause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nITEM 9B.     OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended January 31, 2025, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) informed us of the \nadoption\n or \ntermination\n of a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K), except as follows. \nOn \nDecember 17, 2024\n, \nParker Harris\n, \nCo-Founder and Chief Technology Officer\n, Slack, \nadopted\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to \n150,662\n shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain conditions, through \nDecember 15, 2025\n (or the date all shares are sold under the arrangement, if earlier).\n \nOn \nJanuary 9, 2025\n, \nMarc Benioff\n, \nChair and Chief Executive Officer\n, \nadopted\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to \n353,684\n shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain conditions, through \nMarch 20, 2026\n (or the date all shares are sold under the arrangement, if earlier).\n\nITEM 9C.
