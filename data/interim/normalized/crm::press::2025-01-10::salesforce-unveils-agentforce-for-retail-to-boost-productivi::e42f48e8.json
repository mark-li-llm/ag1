Agentforce makes trusted,\nautonomous AI agents\npart of every team, increasing employee capacity across marketing, commerce, merchandising, and store operations with digital teammates that handle complex tasks with precision, accuracy, and personalization. Scalable digital labor will help retailers reach new levels of productivity — responding to customer questions in real time, modifying orders, issuing returns, managing inventory, scheduling consultations, and even coordinating with shipping providers‌ — all without the need for human intervention.\nThese new Agentforce skills are designed to unlock more capacity to serve shoppers, drive costs down, and increase shopper conversion. They complement existing skills already available for\nmerchandisers\n,\nmarketers\n, and\ncustomer service reps\n. New skills include:\nCommerce Skills for Order Management\nbring order servicing to Agentforce, allowing retailers to offer self-service order servicing options that reduce costs and boost customer loyalty. With these new skills, customers can conversationally update order information like payment or shipping details, handle uneven exchanges, or quickly inquire about order status on the channel they prefer.\nCommerce Skills for Guided Shopping\nhelp retailers scale personalized one-to-one concierge services to digital proportions, with new skills for guided shopping. Shoppers can use natural language to get product recommendations from an agent calculated by Agentforce and grounded in shopper, inventory, and operational data. New actions allow customers to search for products, add items to their cart, and checkout conversationally.\nField Service Skills for Appointment Scheduling\nassist service representatives in facilitating appointment bookings for deliveries, installations, or consultations, powered by AI-driven scheduling and real-time availability updates.\nMarketing Skills for Loyalty Promotion Creation\nassist marketers in creating and revising loyalty promotions with conversational prompts grounded in shopper, POS, and segmentation data resulting in more\npersonalized email content\nand subject lines that increase customer engagement.\nSalesforce is also introducing\nRetail Cloud with Modern POS\n, which arms retailers with a user-friendly, cloud-based POS. This system brings online and offline shopping and inventory data together on a single platform, giving associates a single tool to serve their shoppers better and faster. Features include:\nClienteling, Inventory Management, Endless Aisle, and built-in AI powered by real-time shopper and inventory data:\nAssociates can create and modify shopper profiles that capture shopping history, preferences, and loyalty status; view and update inventory across warehouses, commerce channels, and supply chain; action on analytics from omni-channel customer, order, inventory, and sales performance data; and activate AI for voice assistance, return fraud analysis, and personalized product recommendations.\nMixed Cart and Omni-channel Fulfillment give shoppers more delivery and exchange options while reducing supply chain costs:\nAn omni-cart architecture allows each line item to have its own fulfillment method, offering a single “mixed cart” with shopper fulfillment preferences including buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS), buy-online-return-in-store, and omni exchange.\nMobile-first design and secure offline mode release associates from the checkout counter:\nOffline-capable software enables checkouts anywhere shoppers are ready. Payment transactions are encrypted and stored, ready to be processed when an associate reconnects, allowing sales to occur during a loss of internet, remote and outdoor activity, or peak shopping activity.\nBuilt-in Salesforce integrations and no-code CMS get retailers up and running quickly:\nIntegrations with\nSalesforce Commerce Cloud\n,\nOrder Management\n, and\nService Cloud\nlet retailers quickly access customer data insights, order management, cart synchronization, product information management, and more. The cloud-based CMS uses intuitive drag-and-drop features to tailor the interface to each store’s unique brand.\nRetail Cloud + Agentforce increase workforce productivity across front- and back-office teams:\nAI agents perform best when grounded in accurate, up-to-date customer and operational data. To unlock this value, retailers require solutions that can unify, action, and scale data from both online and offline shopping activity.\nWith Salesforce’s Modern POS and\nData Cloud\n, retailers can harmonize data and metadata from in-store, commerce, marketing, service, and loyalty systems to give employees and associates a unified, near real-time view of activity across the entire shopper journey. Retailers can now use Agentforce, with enhanced\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG), to retrieve and take action on this data and deliver precise answers, tailored engagements, and upsell opportunities with every shopper interaction.\nWhy it matters:\nIn a Salesforce study, 81% of retail executives say that inefficient processes and technology drain associate productivity. Store associates alone log in to more than 16 different applications and systems each day, leaving nearly 78% of store associates without a single, actionable view of their shoppers — resulting in lost productivity and fragmented shopping experiences.\nThe Salesforce perspective:\n“Together, AI-fueled digital labor and a modern POS can unlock a new scale of operational capacity for retailers. With these latest Agentforce skills for retail and a cloud-based, intuitive POS system, Salesforce is helping retailers deliver seamless, unified shopping experiences across both the physical and digital realms of retail that drive productivity advancements and business growth across their entire enterprise.” – Nitin Mangtani, SVP & GM, Retail, Salesforce\nTogether, AI-fueled digital labor and a modern POS can unlock a new scale of operational capacity for retailers.\nNitin Mangtani, SVP & GM, Retail, Salesforce\nCustomer perspective:\n“At SharkNinja, our team is driven by a passion for delivering high-performing technology to every consumer.
