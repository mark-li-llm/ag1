Today, IT environments are more complex than ever before, and MuleSoft has emerged as the leading unified platform for integration, automation, and API management. MuleSoft provides easy-to-use tools to connect systems and data from anywhere — on-premises, cloud, or hybrid.\nUsing MuleSoft, both IT and business users can do more with less, quickly creating AI-powered workflows and integrations that enable the creation of efficient growth and differentiated customer experiences.\nHow is MuleSoft different from other integration and automation solutions?\nOver a decade ago, MuleSoft was the first to introduce the world to\nAPI-led connectivity\n, and redefined integration for IT. Over time, we've expanded our product portfolio to include\nautomation\n,\nAPI management\n, and\nAI\n, because we recognize that end-to-end digital transformation is dependent on accessing these capabilities on a single, unified platform.\nMuleSoft is now the trusted solution in the market. We’re Leaders in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for API Management, and Visionary in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA)\n.\nAdditionally, MuleSoft has quickly risen to become one of the fastest growing Salesforce cloud products by driving meaningful results and value for Trailblazers across industries.\nDoes MuleSoft integrate non-Salesforce systems?\nThe average enterprise has data siloed across over 900 systems, and only one-third of those are integrated.\nIn order to make the Customer 360 vision a reality, you must be able to bring all of your customer data to bear, and to leverage all of your siloed systems and applications. With MuleSoft, customers can quickly connect to any system, both inside and outside of Salesforce.\nWhat are the advantages for Salesforce customers who use MuleSoft?\nTogether, MuleSoft and Salesforce offer customers access to MuleSoft integration and\nautomation\n, without leaving the Salesforce platform. For example, directly from your Salesforce instance, you can invoke MuleSoft APIs, Flows, or RPA bots.\nAdditionally, MuleSoft and Salesforce offer customers the ability to accelerate delivery using hundreds of pre-built connectors and accelerators.\nHow will MuleSoft reduce the complexity of my existing architecture?\nAt MuleSoft, we pioneered the concept of\ncomposability\nas the foundation for successful innovation strategies. The goal of this integration approach is to reduce complexity and increase agility using standardized, reusable building blocks — like\nAPIs\n— to build new experiences, products, and services instead of writing\ncustom code\nor starting from scratch with every project.\nMuleSoft combines our technology with best-in-class methodologies to help customers reduce complexity and reimagine customer experience.\nIs MuleSoft expensive?\nMuleSoft is often compared to lower cost competitors that only offer basic solutions in one area:\nintegration\n,\nautomation\n, or\nAPI management\n. Unlike these point solutions, MuleSoft is a market leader, providing a unified platform with robust capabilities across all three categories.\nWhat’s more, MuleSoft has evolved its pricing and packaging to lower the barrier to entry, and to provide increased flexibility based on customer needs.", "word_count": 1495, "token_count": 1977, "ingestion_ts": "2025-09-06T21:57:16.325711", "hash_sha256": "3af50db29fb57fd66b177036c9033fcf1d9b949ce40adbf6ded77a72cf8a1073", "html_title": "", "meta_published_time": "", "last_modified_http": "", "full_domain": "www.salesforce.com", "publish_date_provenance": "missing", "publish_date_confidence": 0.0, "was_fallback_today": false, "link_ok": true, "link_status": 200}
