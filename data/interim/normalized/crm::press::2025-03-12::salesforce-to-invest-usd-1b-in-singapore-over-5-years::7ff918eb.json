This investment underscores Salesforce’s support for Singapore’s National AI Strategy 2.0 and the nation’s vision as a driver of global AI innovation.\nSpurred by a\nUSD $6 trillion digital labor market\n, thousands of customers around the world are investing in\nAgentforce\n, Salesforce’s\ndigital labor\nplatform, to build and deploy agents that can reason, decide, act, and drive meaningful outcomes 24/7‌. Singapore has been dealing with a slowing growth rate of the labor force, contributed by an aging population and declining birth rates. Agentforce delivers Singapore an opportunity to rapidly expand its labor force in many key service and public sector roles.\nThis investment will help support Singapore enterprises as they build limitless digital workforces, bringing humans together with trusted autonomous Agentforce agents to unlock new levels of productivity, innovation, and growth. As Agentforce adoption accelerates, it has the potential to drive significant impact‌ ‌across Singapore’s industries, startups, and the public sector‌.\nMr Jermaine Loy, Managing Director of the Singapore Economic Development Board said:\n“Singapore welcomes Salesforce’s investment, which will boost our ongoing efforts to build a vibrant hub for AI innovation and adoption across our economy. Salesforce’s initiatives in AI research and workforce development will strengthen our ecosystem by catalysing innovation for key industries and corporates based in Singapore.”\n“We are in an incredible new era of digital labor where every business will be transformed by autonomous agents that augment the work of humans, revolutionizing productivity and enabling every company to scale without limits,” said\nMarc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce\n. “Singapore is at the forefront of this shift, and as the world’s largest provider of digital labor through our Agentforce platform, Salesforce is thrilled to expand our work with the business community and our longtime partners in the region to drive innovation, productivity, and growth.”\nDriving global Agentforce innovation from Singapore\nSalesforce has been investing in Singapore for nearly two decades and has established a thriving customer base and partner ecosystem in the region. Customers of all sizes, including industry leaders like Singapore Airlines, Grab, M1, FairPrice Group, Ocean Network Express, and PRISM+ are using Salesforce AI technologies to drive efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and unlock new revenue streams.\nSingapore plays a crucial role in driving Agentforce innovation for Salesforce. In 2019, Salesforce expanded its\nAI Research team\ninternationally, choosing Singapore as its first overseas AI Research hub location. Since then, the hub has significantly contributed to the global development of AI for the industry. This includes development of industry leading models such as multimodal language-vision foundation models (BLIP), and time-series foundation models (Moirai). The AI Research hub has contributed to product innovations such as AIOps Agents that help Salesforce achieve highest levels of site availability and in-house code LLMs for helping customers optimize their code for performance. Their work has resulted in over 100 research papers and patents being published.\nThis continued investment will not only drive Agentforce innovation through the research hub but also support Salesforce’s expanding customer base in the region.\nIn fact, Singapore Airlines and Salesforce today\nannounced\nthat the Airline is incorporating Agentforce, Einstein in Service Cloud, and Data Cloud into its customer case management system, enabling it to deliver more consistent and personalized service to its customers.\nThe two companies also plan to co-develop AI solutions for airlines at the Salesforce AI Research hub in Singapore, aiming to provide greater value and additional benefits to the industry.\nBringing local data residency for Agentforce to Singapore\nSalesforce is expanding its services on\nHyperforce\n, Salesforce’s trusted next-generation platform architecture, in Singapore to provide data residency for Data Cloud, Agentforce, and Unified Marketing Applications (UMA) by next month.\nThis will empower Singapore businesses to capitalize on Salesforce’s Agentforce and data offerings while adhering to local data residency regulations, an imperative for regional and global organizations in regulated industries such as the government, financial services, or telecommunications. This helps align with data privacy regulations, enhancing data security and fostering trust among customers and stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to compliance.\nSalesforce first introduced Hyperforce in Singapore in 2021.\nBuilding an Agentforce-ready workforce\nSalesforce is refreshing its Singapore office with a new space to enable customers to transform their workforce with digital labor. The space will include Agentforce activations space and a demo pod to provide hands-on experience building and deploying trusted, autonomous AI agents through Agentforce. The new space will also be used for upskilling initiatives for the ecosystem of partners and the community.\nSalesforce remains committed to investing in workforce development by upskilling in Agentforce, ensuring the workforce is equipped for the jobs of the future.\nThe company is partnering with Institutes of Higher Learning such as Singapore Management University, Institute of Technical Education, and Ngee Ann Polytechnic to equip students with in-demand CRM and AI skills through training and certifications, as well as connection to opportunities for employment in the Salesforce ecosystem.\nLeveraging\nTrailhead\n, Salesforce’s free training platform, these initiatives equip individuals with the skills essential for thriving careers in the digital economy.\nSalesforce’s commitment to giving back\nAn important part of Salesforce’s culture is the belief that business is the greatest platform for change, reflected in the company’s 1-1-1 model of corporate philanthropy, which dedicates 1% of the company’s equity, 1% of its employees’ time, and 1% of its products to giving back. Over the last two decades, Salesforce Singapore and its employees have spent over 190,000 hours volunteering in their communities and giving over $2 million to non-profits and NGOs. Partners include Halogen Foundation and Waterways Watch Society. Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore, the Chinese Development Assistance Council, and Dementia Singapore are some of the many non-profits in Singapore running on Salesforce.\n*Salesforce is the\n#1 CRM\n, powered by AI\ntechnology\nand\ncapabilities\n.\nShare article\nJust For You\nSalesforce Quarterly Highlights: FY26 Q2 Product Releases and Corporate Announcements\n8 min read\nIn the Agentic Era, Human Imagination Must Shape the Jobs of Tomorrow\n14 min read\nBuild and customize autonomous AI agents to support your employees and customers 24/7.\nDiscover Agentforce\nShare article\nJust For You\nSalesforce Quarterly Highlights: FY26 Q2 Product Releases and Corporate Announcements\n8 min read\nIn the Agentic Era, Human Imagination Must Shape the Jobs of Tomorrow\n14 min read\nBuild and customize autonomous AI agents to support your employees and customers 24/7.\nDiscover Agentforce\nExplore related content by topic\nAgents\nDigital Transformation\nAbout Salesforce\nSalesforce helps organizations of any size reimagine their business with AI.
